Let’s consider scenario entire platform either treated control. case assignment mechanism choice Spanish-speakers; allowed choose platform want stand .

Selection bias person assigning treatment chooses basis potential outcomes. Spanish-speakers choosing platforms stand randomly. Rather, making treatment decisions based directly potential outcomes platform. Remember, whenever assignment mechanism correlated potential outcomes confounding, problem means estimand biased. examples confounding caused selection bias, selection bias always confoundingMuch like best way avoid making poor inferences sample population take random sample population, best assignment mechanism avoiding confounding randomization. platform flip coin determine treatment control group.Randomized assignment best assignment mechanism inferring average treatment effect sample large enough, difference sample means treated control units (\\(\\widehat{ATE}\\)) close ‘actual’ ATE sample. (still can’t know individual treatment effects without assumptions, fundamental problem causal inference.)Randomized assignments don’t look . example, randomized block assignment method random assignment can useful reducing potential confounding, making even better estimator pure random assignment. random block assignment, subjects experiment subdivided blocks. assignment blocks random, instead intentionally less variation within blocks . Within blocks subjects randomly assigned treatment control.example, let’s use method random block assignment train study. example, might think systematic differences platforms might impact treatment effect. Instead randomly assigning platforms control treated, use random block assignment. platform block. randomly assign half individuals block (platform) control (section platform Spanish-speakers), half treated (section platform Spanish-speakers). resulting random assignment look something like : Block random assignment ensures treated control groups equal proportion individuals platform. assignment mechanism way remove differences platforms potential source variability, therefore minimizing potential source confounding. Individuals within block still randomly assigned, just example different way use random assignment.interested causal inference, randomized trials best approach. many circumstances, however, randomized trials possible due ethical practical concerns. scenarios necessity non-random assignment mechanism.example, let’s say train platforms experiment loud Spanish-speakers might heard anyone nearby. Therefore necessity, quieter platforms can assigned treatment group. non-random assignment may introduce confounding. Say systematic difference people quieter platforms compared people louder platforms. case, assignment mechanism correlated potential outcomes, confounding. means even simple estimand like ATE biased.Many statistical methods developed causal inference non-random assignment mechanism, propensity score matching. methods attempt correct assignment mechanism finding control units similar treatment units. naively compare sample means treatment control assume good estimate ATE.
