<!-- Start by reading the distribution section of Chapter 2: -->
<!-- https://ppbds.github.io/primer/wrangling.html#distributions -->
<!-- This is the knowledge which readers start with. Remind them of it. -->
<!-- Then read the virtual sampling sectioon of Chapter 6: -->
<!-- https://ppbds.github.io/primer/one-parameter.html#virtual-sampling -->
<!-- This is what we are preparing readers for. We want that to be easy for them, once they get there. We should also do a better job of connecting this code to the code in Chapter 5 but, right now, we don't show that to readers. -->
<!-- * Need to focus more on functions which actually do something useful, something that teaches concepts which will be valuable later. One idea: A function which takes a tibble and a variable to sample from. It returns one value from that variable. Complexity is added because it removed all missing data first. Could use nhanes as the data set to play with. Further complexity could be added by adding a condition which filters the tibble in some way. my_sampler() -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- my_sampler <- function(x, var, n = 1){ -->
<!--  x %>% -->
<!--    select(var) %>% -->
<!--    drop_na() %>% -->
<!--    sample_n(n) %>% -->
<!--    slice() -->
<!-- } -->
<!-- my_sampler(x = kenya, var = "poverty") -->
<!-- my_sampler(nhanes, var = "height") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- tibble(ID = 1:10) %>%  -->
<!-- tibble(ID = 1:10) %>%  -->
<!--   mutate(height = map_dbl(ID, ~ my_sampler(nhanes, "height"))) %>%  -->
<!--   mutate(height_list = map(ID, ~ my_sampler(nhanes, "height", n = 10))) %>%  -->
<!--   mutate(avg_height = map_dbl(height_list, ~ mean(.))) -->
<!-- Plot histograms of average height with different n's. Can also do with standard deviation. -->
<!-- Lesson: Larger N means more stable estimates. -->
<!-- Perhaps there are three main parts to the chapter. The first is lists, list-columns, map functions and custom functions. We can cover all that with fairly simple examples. (Don't use N argument yet. Just solve the no NA problem.) Second, as discussed below, is explorations of measures of center and variability for distributions. (Means we need to extend my_sampler with n argument.) We can explore those things with our new tools. The third section plays the Guessing Game. -->
<!-- Read, and then delete, the Crooked Casino section. -->
<!-- Key concept to focus on is the idea of a distribution and draws therefrom. This connects to chapter 2, where we introduced distributions and to chapter 5, where we explain probability distributions. In particular, we should show various ways to measure center and variability. These are cool and important concepts. Is "center" the mean or the median or the trimmed mean or . . . Is "variability" the standard deviation, the mean absolute deviation, the standard deviation of the median absolute deviation or . . . There is nothing explicitly "statistical" here. We are just trying to connect English words to specific formulas. We might show the distributions for which these measures give the same answers and then some (mainly skewed) for which they don't. How to explore these concepts in the context of function writing? Perhaps by writing functions like my_mean() and my_median()? Or maybe focus on a function which calculates MAD SD? Then use list-columns to compare this function to other choices? -->
<!-- Lesson: If you have a really skewed distribution, then median is a more stable measure than mean, and MAD (median absolute difference -- which means absolute difference from the median) is a more stable measure than standard deviation. Results depends too much on who ended up in the sample, like Bill Gates. -->
<!-- Related: Teach random draws. We introduce random variables at the end of chapter 2. Do more with them here. For example, with a data set, calculated a mean and sd. Then do 1,000 draws from that. Then, plot the densities of the raw data and the simulated data on top of one another. -->
<!-- Standard errors, qua standard errors, are a tricky thing to teach. But what if, instead of teaching them as standard errors, we just introduce the formula as a simple way to approximate something which, when multiplied by 2, and then added/subtracted from the mean, gives you a pretty useful 95% confidence interval. Then we could do the same for MAD SD, and show how that works better for skewed variables! Here, "works better" means that, if you do it 1,000 times, it works better on average. No! Too much! -->
<!-- The main use case is the "Guessing Game." Imagine that you are I are using the kenya data set and the distance, pop_density or rv13 variables. (All of which are quite skewed. We might also experiment with the poverty variable, which is less skewed. But skewed variables make this more interesting.) -->
<!-- In the Guessing Game, you guess a number and I guess a number. The goal is to get closest to a random draw from all the values of distance (or whatever). We do this 1,000 times. Whoever gets closer more often, wins the Guessing Game.  -->
<!-- This is a useful exercise for several reasons. First, coding it up is a good practice for writing a function. Indeed, we might re-write the whole chapter to focus on this example. Second, once we have a function, which runs one iteration of the Game --- maybe it takes the data set (or maybe a vector of values?), my guess and your guess, and then returns the winner --- we can use list columns and map_functions to run it a thousand times. This is all more fun and more interesting that stupid max-minus-min functions. -->
<!-- Third, the Guessing Game gets at key statistical issues. There is a lot of meat there, all things that we will revisit many times. Some things to highlight, many of which can be put into the Guessing Game. -->
<!-- 1) Guess a formula rather than a number. Presumably, you and I get to see (all of?) the data before playing the game. In the simplest version, we look at the data and give you a number. (The mean and median both do well in this game, obviously.) But, in a more advanced form of the game, we might be allowed to provide a function. The goal of inference is to come up with a function which wins the prediction game.) -->
<!-- 2) Change the objective function. The simplest form of the Guessing Game just counts each contest separately. A more advanced for would give you a penalty which varies depending on how wrong you are. (This, obviously, is one way to think about minimizing the squared residuals.) This is very fun because there are many different penalty functions, each of which may lead to a different function winning the Guessing Game. -->
<!-- 3) The chapter climaxes with the following cool result: If you are minimizing the sum (or average) of the squared residuals, guessing the mean wins the Guessing Game. However, if you are minimizing the sum (or average) of the absolute values of the residuals, you should guess the median. -->
<!-- 4) Another form of the Guessing Game is like a casino. One person (the Casino) gives a 50% confidence interval. The other person gets to pick either inside or outside. Then there is a draw. The Casino wins if the second person can't consistently win. -->
<!-- Key question: Do we explain standard error here? Could be easy! Calculate the mean. Calculate the sd. Divide and scale by the square root of n. Voila! But, still, I think No. But we should explain everything short of standard error.  -->
<!-- group_nest() might be a useful function.  -->
<!-- Might also show how to add lots of plots to a tibble and then pick out the ones that show cool stuff. If you run 1,000 experiments, show the plots of the 5 extreme ones. -->

<p>The goal of this chapter is to reveal the <strong>process</strong> a long-time useR employs for writing functions. We also want to illustrate why the process is the way it is. Merely looking at the finished product, e.g. source code for R packages, can be extremely deceiving. Reality is generally much uglier … but more interesting! Powerful packages like <strong>dplyr</strong> and <strong>purrr</strong> are ready and waiting to apply your purpose-built functions to various bits of your data. If you can express your analytic wishes in a function, these tools will give you great power.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>First, let’s introduce the concept of functions. A function is a piece of code that is packaged in a way that makes it easy to reuse. Functions make it easy for you to <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html">filter()</a></code>, <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/arrange.html">arrange()</a></code>, <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html">select()</a></code>, and create a <code>tibble()</code>, as you have seen in the last few chapters. Functions also allow you to transform variables and perform a bunch of useful mathematical calculations, such as finding the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Extremes.html">min()</a></code>, <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Extremes.html">max()</a></code>, and <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/quantile.html">quantile()</a></code>s of a dataset. Functions are also important in generating data and values, such as using <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/Normal.html">rnorm()</a></code> to randomly generate a normal distribution.</p>
<p>Note that every time we discuss a function, we include the parentheses. This is because you call a function by including its parentheses and any necessary arguments in those parentheses. This is a correct call of <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/Normal.html">rnorm()</a></code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb519"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/Normal.html">rnorm</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">1</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.98</code></pre>
<p>If you run the function name without its parentheses, R will return the code that makes up the function.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb521"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">rnorm</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## function (n, mean = 0, sd = 1) 
## .Call(C_rnorm, n, mean, sd)
## &lt;bytecode: 0x7f90eab1b5c0&gt;
## &lt;environment: namespace:stats&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Functions can do all sorts of things. Below, <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/sample.html">sample()</a></code> takes a vector of values and spits out a number of random values from that vector. You can specify the number of random values with the argument <code>size</code>. Let’s take it for a spin. This is the equivalent of rolling a die!</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb523"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/sample.html">sample</a></span><span class="op">(</span>x <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">1</span><span class="op">:</span><span class="fl">6</span>, size <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">1</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 2</code></pre>
<p>Functions can also take in other functions as arguments. For example, <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/lapply.html">replicate()</a></code> takes an expression and repeats it <code>n</code> times. What if we replicated the rolling of a die ten times?</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb525"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/lapply.html">replicate</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">10</span>, <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/sample.html">sample</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">1</span><span class="op">:</span><span class="fl">6</span>, <span class="fl">1</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##  [1] 2 4 6 2 4 2 3 3 1 6</code></pre>
<p>An especially useful type of function is the family of <code>map_*</code> functions. <code>map_*</code> functions come from the <strong>purrr</strong> package, which you will have loaded if you have loaded <strong>tidyverse</strong>. These functions apply the same function to every row in a tibble.</p>
<p>Let’s create a tibble with 3 values: 3, 7, and 2.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb527"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu">tibble</span><span class="op">(</span>x <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html">c</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">3</span>, <span class="fl">7</span>, <span class="fl">2</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 3 x 1

## 1     3
## 2     7

<p>What if we wanted to take the square root of each value?</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb529"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu">tibble</span><span class="op">(</span>x <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html">c</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">3</span>, <span class="fl">7</span>, <span class="fl">2</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span>

<pre><code>## # A tibble: 3 x 2

<p><code>map_dbl()</code> (pronounced “map-double”) took the function <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/MathFun.html">sqrt()</a></code> and applied it to each element of <code>x</code>. Note that, when we passed the function <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/MathFun.html">sqrt()</a></code> to <code>map_dbl()</code>, we passed in just its name, without the closing parentheses. This code fails:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb531"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu">tibble</span><span class="op">(</span>x <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html">c</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">3</span>, <span class="fl">7</span>, <span class="fl">2</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span> 
  <span class="fu"><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html">mutate</a></span><span class="op">(</span>new <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu">map_dbl</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">x</span>, <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/MathFun.html">sqrt</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## Error: Problem with `mutate()` input `new`.
## x 0 arguments passed to 'sqrt' which requires 1
## ℹ Input `new` is `map_dbl(x, sqrt())`.</code></pre>
<p><code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/MathFun.html">sqrt()</a></code> with the parentheses is a call to the function. So, the first thing R tries to do is to run the function. Doing so fails because <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/MathFun.html">sqrt()</a></code> requires an argument <code>x</code>, which is empty.</p>
<p><em>Lesson</em>: When passing a function in to <code>map_*</code> functions, pass just the name.</p>
<p>We called these <code>map_*</code> <em>functions</em> (plural) before. If you know the expected output of your function, you can specify that kind of vector:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>map()</code>: list<br>
</li>
<li>
<code>map_lgl()</code>: logical</li>
<li>
<code>map_int()</code>: integer</li>
<li>
<code>map_dbl()</code>: double (numeric)</li>
<li>
<code>map_chr()</code>: character</li>
<li>
<code>map_df()</code>: data frame</li>
</ul>
<p>So, since our example produces numeric output, we use <code>map_dbl()</code> instead of <code>map()</code>.</p>
<p>Now, you may be wondering, what’s the difference between using <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html">mutate()</a></code> and <code>map_*</code> functions? The answer lies in iteration, which is the specialization of the <strong>purrr</strong> package. <code>map_*</code> functions are powerful because of their ability to apply functions to every single element of a list, which <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html">mutate()</a></code> cannot handle.</p>
<p>Speaking of lists, <code>map_*</code> functions are known to take in list inputs, and sometimes even create list-columns depending on the specific <code>map_*</code> function.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb533"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu">tibble</span><span class="op">(</span>x <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html">c</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">3</span>, <span class="fl">7</span>, <span class="fl">2</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span> 
  <span class="fu"><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html">mutate</a></span><span class="op">(</span>new <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu">map</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">x</span>, <span class="va">sqrt</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 3 x 2
##       x new      
##   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;list&gt;   
## 1     3 &lt;dbl [1]&gt;
## 2     7 &lt;dbl [1]&gt;
## 3     2 &lt;dbl [1]&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Notice that we changed the <code>map_dbl()</code> to <code>map()</code>, which returns a list-column. You can use <code>str</code> to easily view the contents of a list-column.</p>

<p>Only… what exactly is a list-column? Our next section will give you a quick refresher on lists, then dive into how lists, list-columns, and <code>map_*</code> functions relate.</p>

</h2>
<p>Let’s quickly refresh on what lists are and functions that commonly deal with lists. Recall that a list is different from an atomic vector. Atomic vectors are familiar to us: each element of the vector has one value, and thus if an atomic vector is a column in your dataset, each observation gets a single value.

<p>Right! Recall the example from Chapter 2 in which lists are a pepper jar that contain more pepper packets. Don’t forget the square brackets!</p>
<p>Let’s index through more lists to make sure it works. Remember that lists can contain a multitude of data types. First, let’s create a few new lists. Pay attention to the placement of <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html">list()</a></code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb541"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>As you can see, the two objects defined above are lists. It also displays the data type of each element. <code>list_1</code> is a list of length 3, with a character, a numeric, and a character. <code>list_2</code> is also a list of length 3, with a numeric, a character, and a numeric. Note that the <code>[1:3]</code> denotes a numeric vector of length 3 for <code>x</code>.</p>
<p>Now, let’s extract the first element of each of the new lists.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb547"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">list_1</span><span class="op">[[</span><span class="fl">1</span><span class="op">]</span><span class="op">]</span><span class="op">[</span><span class="fl">1</span><span class="op">]</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] "Three"</code></pre>

<pre><code>## [1] 3</code></pre>
<p>You might be wondering, how is the list <code>x</code> different from the lists <code>list_1</code> and <code>list_2</code>? Besides the contents of the lists, we wanted to demonstrate how there are various ways to create lists. You can directly input values inside <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html">list()</a></code>, or wrap the values in <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html">c()</a></code> first to create a vector element.</p>
<p>There are a number of built-in R functions that output lists. For example, the <strong><em>ggplot</em></strong>s you have been making store all of the graph information in lists.</p>
<p>Any function that returns multiple values can be used to create a list output. For example, consider the following list <code>x</code> again:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb551"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">x</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [[1]]
## [1] 3 7 2</code></pre>
<p>If we take the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/range.html">range()</a></code> of <code>x</code>, we expect two values to be returned: the minimum value and the maximum value in the numeric vector.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb553"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/range.html">range</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">x</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>

<pre><code>## [1] "numeric"</code></pre>
<p>The output of <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/range.html">range(x)</a></code> is a numeric vector with two values, 2 and 7. To turn the output into a list, simply wrap the line of code with <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html">list()</a></code>.</p>

<pre><code>## [1] "list"</code></pre>
<p>What if we want to create a tibble with the values of <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/range.html">range(x)</a></code>?</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb561"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

##   col_1    
##   &lt;list&gt;   
## 1 &lt;dbl [2]&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Notice this is a 1x1 tibble with one observation, which is a list of one element. The element is a vector of the integers 2 and 7. Voila! You have just created a *list-column**.</p>
<p>Lesson: If a function returns multiple values as a vector, like <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/range.html">range()</a></code> does, you can’t use it directly to obtain a list-column, but you can wrap <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html">list()</a></code> around it in order to get the same behavior.</p>
<p>A list column is a column of your data which is a <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/vectors-chap.html#lists">list</a> rather than an atomic vector. Like with lists, you can pipe in <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/str.html">str()</a></code> to read the column more easily.</p>

<p>Note that this is a case where it is crucial to use <code>tibble()</code>, not <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/data.frame.html">data.frame()</a></code>! If we had used <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/data.frame.html">data.frame()</a></code> in the last example, it wouldn’t have worked how we wanted:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb565"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<pre><code>##   c.2..7.

<p>Note that the output is a 2 x 1 dataframe with double observations, not one singular list.</p>
<p>Wrapping a function with <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html">list()</a></code> is often how we will go about creating list columns. Let’s practice with the <code>kenya</code> dataset. How could we add a column to the dataset that included the quantiles of the <code>poverty</code> variable?</p>
<p>First, we load the necessary <strong>primer.data</strong> library, select the relevant variables, and group by <code>block</code>. We are grouping because we are curious as to how the poverty rates look when aggregated by block, rather than as individual observations.</p>

<p>Next, we will create a list-column by wrapping <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/quantile.html">quantile()</a></code> with <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html">list()</a></code>. <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/quantile.html">quantile()</a></code> naturally produces a numeric vector of the quantiles of <code>poverty</code>, and wrapping with <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html">list()</a></code> will capture this numeric vector as a list.</p>

<p>Or let’s say that we wanted 1) to subset the dataset to the those with <code>treatment == "control"</code>, 2) group by <code>block</code>, and 3) get a <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html">summary()</a></code> of the <code>distance</code> variable by continent:</p>

</h3>
<p>For this example, we will use the <code>nhanes</code> dataset from the <strong>primer.data</strong> package to demonstrate how to use <code>map_*</code> functions to create list columns.</p>
<p>First, let’s wrangle the data so each observation is grouped by age and gender. We’ll create a list column <code>all_weights</code> that consists of every subject’s weight, grouped by age and gender.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb573"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">nhanes</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span>
  <span class="fu"><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_by.html">group_by</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">age</span>, <span class="va">gender</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span>

<p>Now that we have a list column, we can use it as the input to <code>map()</code>, outputting another list column. Let’s say we wanted a new list column, <code>log_weights</code>, which takes the logarithmic value of each weight observation.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb574"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">nhanes</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span>

<p>Note that we took the list column <code>all_weights</code> and, by applying an anonymous function to it with <code>map()</code>, created another list column <code>log_weights</code>. This is a very common process. It is similar to taking a tibble and piping it into a <code>dplyr</code> function (such as <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html">mutate()</a></code>) which gives you a new tibble that you can work with.</p>
<p>If we try to replace the <code>map()</code> function in the last line with a simple <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html">mutate()</a></code>, we will get an error.</p>
<pre><code>## Error: Problem with `mutate()` input `log_weights`.
## x non-numeric argument to mathematical function
## ℹ Input `log_weights` is `log(all_weights)`.
## ℹ The error occurred in group 1: age = 0.</code></pre>
<p>Again, this is because the <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html">mutate()</a></code> function is ill-equipped to handle lists. We could have avoided creating the list-columns in the first place and found the log weight of each observation, but then we would be losing out on the grouping ability of lists. Do you see how <code>map_*</code> functions are equipped to handle inputs different from <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html">mutate()</a></code>?</p>
<p>You can also use <code>map_*</code> functions to take a list column as an input and return an atomic vector – a column with a single value per observation – as an output. For instance, let’s say we now wanted the mean of the log weights:</p>

<p>Here, we also see that the <code>map_*</code> functions have the <code>...</code> argument, which allows <code>na.rm = TRUE</code> to be passed along to <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/mean.html">mean()</a></code>.
What if we wanted to extract the top five log weights per row?</p>

<p>See how we chained the <code>map_*</code> functions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<code>all_weights</code> was used as the input to <code>map()</code> to create <code>log_weights</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>log_weights</code> was used as the input to <code>map()</code> to create <code>sorted_log_weights</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>sorted_log_weights</code> was used as the input to <code>map()</code> to create <code>top5_log_weights</code>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Until now, we have practiced using map functions and built-in R functions such as <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Log.html">log()</a></code> and <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/sort.html">sort()</a></code> to create list columns.

<p>We can create functions that do operations “on the fly” without bothering to give them a name. These nameless functions are called <a href="https://coolbutuseless.github.io/2019/03/13/anonymous-functions-in-r-part-1/">anonymous functions.</a></p>
<p>You can use anonymous functions in conjunction with the <code>map_*</code> family of functions. They’re commonly used to conduct mathematical operations repeatedly.</p>
<p>You can call an anonymous function using a <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/tilde.html">~</a></code> operator and then using a <code>.</code> to represent the current element.</p>

<p>The <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/tilde.html">~</a></code> shorthand is very convenient once you get used to it. Let’s see it in an example.

Let’s say that we want to return a list-column with all the recorded temperatures in a day in Celsius and basic summary statistics.</p>
<p>First, let’s wrangle the data so each observation is a day rather than an hour. We will do so by selecting for the necessary variables and grouping by <code>origin</code>, <code>year</code>, <code>month</code>, and <code>day</code>.</p>

<p>There are plenty of built-in functions in R, such as the ones mentioned above. You can also create your own custom functions, which may look something like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb589"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>You just created a function! This function will return <code>1+1</code> whenever called.</p>
<p>Now what if we wanted to leave some mystery in the function? That is to say, we want to add the number 6 to a value <code>x</code>, that the user provides for us.</p>

<p>Congratulations! You have incorporated your first <strong>formal argument</strong>. Formal arguments in functions are additional parameters that allow the user to customize the use of your function. Instead of adding 1+1 over and over again, your function takes in a number <code>x</code> that the user defines and adds 6. Now let’s drive it home and make a function with <em>two</em> formal arguments.</p>

<p>One thing to note about functions is that functions have selective memory. In fact, functions only “remember” what happens within the function itself.</p>
<p>For example, I have saved value <code>x</code> as 1.</p>

<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">x</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fl">1</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Defining <code>x</code> inside a function will not change its value outside of the function.</p>

<p>I know that 10 minus 1 is 9. I know that random uniform [0, 1] variates will be between 0 and 1. Therefore max - min should be less than 1. If I take LOTS of them, max - min should be pretty close to 1.</p>

<p>Now we try to break our function. Don’t get truly diabolical (yet). Just make the kind of mistakes you can imagine making at 2am when, 3 years from now, you rediscover this useful function you wrote. Give your function inputs it’s not expecting.</p>

<p>In both cases, R’s eagerness to make sense of our requests is unfortunately successful. In the first case, a tibble containing just the quantitative variables is eventually coerced into numeric vector. We can compute max minus min, even though it makes absolutely no sense at all. In the second case, a logical vector is converted to zeroes and ones, which might merit an error or at least a warning.</p>

<p><strong>Non-programming uses for assertions</strong></p>
<p>Another good use of this pattern is to leave checks behind in data analytical scripts. If we were loading from file (vs. a stable data package), we might want to formalize our expectations about the number of rows and columns, the names and flavors of the variables, etc. This would alert us if the data suddenly changed, which can be a useful wake-up call in scripts that you re-run <em>ad nauseam</em> on auto-pilot or non-interactively.</p>
<p>In addition to a gratuitous apology, the error also contains two more pieces of helpful info:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Which</em> function threw the error.</li>
<li>Hints on how to fix things: expected class of input vs actual class.</li>
</ul>
<p>If it is easy to do so, we highly recommend this template: “you gave me THIS, but I need THAT.”</p>

</h2>
<p>In this section, we create a new function, generalize it, and learn more technical details about R functions.</p>
<p>Our goal is to write a function that simulates throwing dice.</p>
<p>We will begin by creating a minimally viable function, <code>starter_die()</code>, which throws one die one time.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb646"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">starter_die</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="kw">function</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">{</span>
  <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/sample.html">sample</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">1</span><span class="op">:</span><span class="fl">6</span>, <span class="fl">1</span><span class="op">)</span>
<span class="op">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>From here, we can add a formal argument <code>n</code>, which requires the number of dice to be specified. However, if more than one dice is thrown, we want to make sure that any number from <code>1-6</code> has the chance of being returned. To do so, make sure the <code>replace</code> argument in <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/sample.html">sample()</a></code> is set to <code>TRUE</code>. Now we have generalized the function <code>starter_dice()</code>!</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb647"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">starter_die</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="kw">function</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">n</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">{</span>

<span class="op">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>What if we wanted to add a formal argument, <code>n</code>, that would be passed into <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/sample.html">sample()</a></code>’s n specification? Now let’s create an intermediate function <code>add_dice()</code> which throws n dice and adds the results.</p>

<p>While we can name my argument after a famous painter, it’s usually a bad idea. Take all opportunities to make things more self-explanatory via meaningful names.</p>
<p>If you are going to pass the arguments of your function as arguments of a built-in function, consider copying the argument names. Unless you have a good reason to do your own thing (some argument names are bad!), be consistent with the existing function. Again, the reason is to reduce your cognitive load.</p>
<p>We took this detour so you could see there is no <em>structural</em> relationship between our argument (<code>n</code>) and that of <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/sample.html">sample()</a></code> (which also includes <code>n</code>). The similarity or equivalence of the names <strong>accomplishes nothing</strong> as far as R is concerned; it is solely for the benefit of humans reading, writing, and using the code. Which is very important!</p>

</h3>
<p>Until now, we’ve relied on informal tests such as trying to break our function with silly inputs. If you are going to use a function a lot, especially if it is part of a package, it is wise to use formal unit tests.</p>
<p>The [testthat][testthat-web] package ([CRAN][testthat-cran]; [GitHub][testthat-github]) provides excellent facilities for this, with a distinct emphasis on automated unit testing of entire packages. However, we can take it out for a test drive even with our one measly function.</p>
<p>We will construct a test with <code><a href="https://testthat.r-lib.org/reference/test_that.html">test_that()</a></code> and, within it, we put one or more <em>expectations</em> that check actual against expected results. You simply harden your informal, interactive tests into formal unit tests. Here are some examples of tests and indicative expectations.</p>
<p>Let’s keep our very first function around as a baseline.</p>

<p>Similar to the advice to use assertions in data analytical scripts, I recommend you use unit tests to monitor the behavior of functions you (or others) will use often. If your tests cover the function’s important behavior, then you can edit the internals freely. You’ll rest easy in the knowledge that, if you broke anything important, the tests will fail and alert you to the problem. A function that is important enough for unit tests probably also belongs in a package, where there are obvious mechanisms for running the tests as part of overall package checks.</p>

<p>By default, a function returns the result of the last line of the body. We are just letting that happen with the line <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/sum.html">sum(sample(1:6, n, replace = TRUE))</a></code>. However, there is an explicit function for this: <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/function.html">return()</a></code>. We could just as easily make this the last line of my function’s body:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb669"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/function.html">return</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/sum.html">sum</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/sample.html">sample</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">1</span><span class="op">:</span><span class="fl">6</span>, <span class="va">n</span>, replace <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">TRUE</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You absolutely must use <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/function.html">return()</a></code> if you want to return early based on some condition, i.e. before execution gets to the last line of the body. Otherwise, you can decide your own conventions about when you use <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/function.html">return()</a></code> and when you don’t.</p>
<p>Right now, running <code>add_dice(5)</code> gives us an integer. What if we want the output to be a list of each roll outcome?</p>

<p>The upside to creating our own dice-rolling function is that there have been no missing values. In real life, missing data will make your life a living hell. If you are lucky, it will be properly indicated by the special value <code>NA</code>, but don’t hold your breath. Many built-in R functions have an <code>na.rm =</code> argument through which you can specify how you want to handle <code>NA</code>s. Typically the default value is <code>na.rm = FALSE</code> and typical default behavior is to either let <code>NA</code>s propagate or to raise an error. Let’s see how <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/quantile.html">quantile()</a></code> handles <code>NA</code>s:</p>

<p>This works but it is dangerous to invert the default behavior of a well-known built-in function and to provide the user with no way to override this.</p>
<p>We could add an <code>na.rm =</code> argument to our own function. We might even enforce our preferred default – but at least we’re giving the user a way to control the behavior around <code>NA</code>s.</p>

<p><code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/rep.html">rep()</a></code> is a useful input to <code>map_*</code> when you want to call a function with the same input multiple times. <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/rep.html">rep(2, n)</a></code> creates a vector of length n where every element is 2.

<p>Create a tibble named <code>x</code> with one variable: <code>throws</code>. <code>throws</code> is a list column, each element of which is three throws of the dice pair, i.e., the result of calling <code>roll_dice(n = 3)</code>. Thus, our tibble will have ten rows and two columns.</p>

<p>You can think of <code>case_when()</code> as a generalized <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/ifelse.html">ifelse()</a></code>. The syntax is a little more complicated. Each expression is followed by <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/tilde.html">~</a></code> and what should be returned if that expression is TRUE. The final expression, TRUE, is always true, and thus is the residual category if none of the above expression are TRUE. Thus, the second <code>case_when()</code> in our above code will print “A” if A is the winner in more replications than B, “B” if B is the winner more than A, and “Same # Victories” otherwise.</p>
<p>Side B is more likely to win.</p>
<p>The chance of a tie is approximately 11%.</p>

</h3>
<p>Say we are at an establishment known as the Crooked Casino. In a game of craps, you win if you roll 7 or 11 as the sum of a pair of dice. The Crooked Casino is infamous for rigging its games so that it is more difficult to obtain 7 or 11 as a sum. Our job is to write a function that mimics this behavior.</p>
<p>First, let’s use what we have. We will add a line of code in <code>add_dice()</code> that assigns <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/sum.html">sum(sample(1:6, n, replace = TRUE))</a></code> to a variable, <code>roll</code>, and returns <code>roll</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb706"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<span class="op">}</span>

<span class="fu">crooked_dice</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">2</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] 8</code></pre>
<p>How is this any different from <code>add_dice()</code>, you may ask? It is not. We are merely assigning the outcome of the roll of a pair of dice to a variable <code>roll</code>, which will be useful in a moment. Recall that functions only “remember” what takes place within themselves. This means that each call of <code>crooked_dice()</code> creates a new variable <code>roll</code> that takes place inside the function.</p>
<p>Now, let’s use <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/ifelse.html">ifelse()</a></code> to check whether a 7 or 11 was rolled, and if so, to assign a roll of <code>2</code> instead.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb708"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<span class="op">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The Crooked Casino is a bit more sly, however. They know if they have an overtly crooked game of craps that never returned 7 or 11, that no one would play. They want to be a little more subtle about their crookedness, so they determine that only half of the time a 7 or 11 is rolled will the outcome be altered.</p>
<p>We can simulate this decision by generating a random variable using <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/Uniform.html">runif()</a></code> and checking whether the result is greater than or equal to 0.5.</p>
