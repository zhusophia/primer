<!-- Map functions and list-columns are taught in chapter 5, both the Primer and the tutorial. Take look. Make a PR about things you want to make sure students know, or examples problems we should do. -->
<!-- Need to teach students how to use the standard error. Maybe in tutorial. Emphasize the equivalence of 17% best guess wit 1% SE is the same thing as 17% best guess with a 95% confidence interval of 11% to 23%.   -->
<!-- Read all my old comments. Indicate if they are not clear. -->
<!-- Change first example to not use 1,000 beads for creating the fake distribution. We are no longer discrete. p is continuous! So, sample 10,000 possible values for p.  No need to correspond to the urn limitations. Or maybe just assume we don't know how many beads are in the urn. Yes! That! -->
<!-- RS: For the comment above, should we use rbinom()? Later in the chapter the concern is brought up that using rbinom is not perfect and that sampling directly from the population is better. However, if we wanted to make p continuous and sample from a population of unknown size I think we would be forced to use rbinom(). -->
<!-- 6.3 Sample size (What happens when we change sample size?) -->
<!-- Questions: I feel like we need more explanation about confidence intervals. Also do we want to differentiate between calculating an unknown population proportion and an unknown mu? Nonetheless I feel like understanding that if we take a simple random sample, how to construct a 95% confidence interval using $\bar{x}$ +/- 2(SD), because I feel like it is not emphasized how cool it is how our samples will be normally distributed no matter if if our population is normally distributed, but this could be too much statistics. Also do we introduce N(mu, SE) for a sample? If we went this route we would have to explain the normal distribution and the properties of the normal distribution in more detail, but I think in the long term it would help students to understand studies that include terminology like margin of error, confidence intervals, & p + a values. I feel like like the additional explanations and math would be worth it because you see that terminology come up ALOT. Don't even explain the math, just give good logical explanations with lots of graphics and explain which functions to use.  -->
<!-- - 6.3.1: Comparing sample sizes: Create graph of 1000 p values for several sample sizes. -->
<!-- - 6.3.2: Standard error: Definition of standard error, using both the equation as well as explaining its meaning without all the math.  -->
<!-- - 6.3.3: Graphical explanation: Compare histograms of different sample sizes. (Try and make a gganim.) Display summary lines of mean and standard deviation.  Overlay density distributions over the histograms. -->
<!-- - 6.3.4: SE of n sized sample: Create graph of standard deviation v. sample size, and connection to SE. Try and overlay or put side by side the cloud of points for each sample size and the standard error for each sample size.  -->
<!-- 6.4 Putting everything together -->
<!-- -Goals: Apply everything from the previous sections to answer 2 questions:  -->
<!-- - 6.4.1: The Questions: In a well mixed urn with an unknown number of red and white beads, we get 17 red beads in a random sample of size 50. (Should we use data on more than 1 sample? Also should the questions be hunger games themed?) -->
<!-- 1. What proportion of beads in the urn are red?  -->
<!-- 2. What is the probability that we will draw more than 8 red beads if we use a shovel of size 20?  -->
<!-- Questions: Should we go into more detail about how our one sample of 17 forms a confidence interval which we can use to estimate the population proportion? As of now we kind of just accept that our one sample of 17 is good enough instead of evaluating if it is a good representation of our population, and quantifying how certain we are that our sample represents our population. This would be a good way to further use Standard Error, because I feel as if we introduce it just to never use it again. Also, is it acceptable to use rbinom() to represent our population instead of sampling directly from the population? I did a test and using rbinom() produced an answer that was 1% different than sampling from the population, but obviously both answers involve alot of chance and a slight difference makes sense. Furthermore, I am also slighly concerned that using rbinom() a second time for the second question may be incorrect, so it may be more worthwhile to keep the shovel size constant and use the same data that we used for the first question.  -->
<!-- - 6.4.2: Wisdom: -->
<!-- -- 6.4.2.1: One parameter: Explain that, like the section alludes to, we are finding one parameter for the population. Walk through the thought process on how we need to find the one parameter in the first question to answer the second question.  -->
<!-- -- 6.4.2.2: Preceptor Table: Explain/Create the preceptor table.  -->
<!-- - 6.4.3: Justice: -->
<!-- -- 6.4.3.1: Binomial model: Present binomial equation as the basis for our future models.  -->
<!-- -- 6.4.3.2: Examining validiity: Does phat represent p? Is our data good? -->
<!-- - 6.4.4: Courage: -->
<!-- -- 6.4.4.1: From discrete to continuous: Explain that we no longer know how many beads in the urn, so we will create alot of p values and do 1,000 samples for each one to find the most common probibility for each number of beads.  -->
<!-- -- 6.4.4.2: Joint distribution: Create the joint distribution. Also include rayshader plots.  -->
<!-- -- 6.4.4.3: Hypothesis testing: Explain that hypothesis testing is bad, and that instead we should create a distribution that displays the range of possible outcomes instead of simply disproving one possible outcome.  -->

<!-- -- 6.4.4.5: Binomial Distribution: Compare bead distribution to another binomial distribution such as flipping a coin. Then convert to a probibility distribution, and calculate the answer to the second question. -->

<!-- -- 6.4.5.1: Changing the starting data: What happens if our starting data was different? (Explore different packages that might allow readers to explore this for themselves in a cool way.) -->
<!-- - 6.4.6: stan_glm(): Introduce stan_glm() for Ch. 7. Makes everything we did above way easier.  -->
<!-- 6.5 The Real World -->
<!-- -Notes: Will be mostly the same as current section. -->
<!-- Questions: Use annual family survey (3000 people) instead of kennedy study? This provides an actual dataset we can work with. Introduce the vocab and write up in the primer, and then dive into the dataset in the tutorials. Data set has collumn for "are you married" which allows us to estimate a population proportion, but it also has other data that can allow us to calculate the population mu within a certain confidence interval if we know sigma, but this might be too much. However, I do think it is important to differentiate finding a population mu vs population proportion. Also should I incorporate this into the existing tutorial or make a new tutorial? -->
<!-- - 6.5.1: Kennedy Study: Exact same as current 6.5.2. Compare population, sampling, population params, etc. between Kennedy Study and Bead example.  -->
<!-- - 6.5.2: Experimental Design: This would be new. Discuss basic experimental design and bias. What are some warning signs for bad design? Is the Kennedy Obama Study biased? How about the bead examples? How do we acheive good experimental design. This section would be a brief introduction to topics discussed in an intro stats class.  -->
<!-- -- Add  El Jefe's or Felipe's to this section.  -->
<!-- - 6.5.3: Variance: Talk about standard error in real world, compared to the bead example. Maybe also discuss confidence intervals, and accuracy/precision.  -->
<!-- 6.7 Summary -->
<!-- Old stuff: -->
<!-- Another paragraph or two of discussion about the final posterior. How do we use it? Within what range would you offer 50/50 odds that the true percentage lies? (use quantile(0.25, 0.75). Area under the curve? Explain clearly how that 26% is calculated. What is post_dist? What does it mean? How can I use it? Maybe show it sorted? Add some code comments. -->
<!-- Expand the use of rayshader. For each 3-D graphic, we need to add a movie with five frames. First frame is the current graphic. Second frame is with the conditional distribution set as a different color, probably red. We want to see this slice in the context of the joint distribution. Third frame shows the joint distribution with all non-red points going to zero. Ideally, this would be in motion, with the points just decreasing down. The meaning is that taking a conditional distribution means that everything outside that slice goes to zero. They are impossible. Fourth frame shows us rotate around so that we are looking at the cross-section from the side. -->
<!-- You must understand what the standard error of $\hat{p}$ means. You do not need to understand why. -->
<!-- In the Functions are your friend! section -->
<!-- The variation in p-hat (when we do 1,000 reps) decreases as shovel size increases. For each shovel size, you plot 1,000 points. Small shovels have lots of overlap, so, use alpha. Even big shovels only have scores of possible p-hats. Then, say, can we measure the decrease in varition more precisely then just looking at this cloud of points? Yes! Plot the standard deviation of the cloud for each shovel size. -->
<!-- RS: Graph 1,000 points of phat? Woudn't this be misleading, because of like what is said above, that small shovels only have a few possible models?-->
<!-- Maybe make it a gganimation? -->
<!-- Explain in a comment the reason for  fun = function(.x) 1/(2 * sqrt(.x)) in the plot. I don't know why we need the 2. We would probably use geom_function(). Maybe using geom_function with the function for a standard error will just magically work! -->
<!-- A paragraph about the distinction between distributions and probability distributions. We often can work with the former till the very end. When answering most questions, I can just work with the "raw" distribution. I don't need the posterior probability distribution. -->
<!-- RS: Still confused about this myself. Wouldn't we always want to end with a standardized posterior probability distribution? Standardized just seems better. -->
<!-- Could not get figure references to work. They have been removed. But we ought to figure that out and add them back!  Should create a simple example (three line Rmd file) and then ask on RStudio Community.  -->
<!-- Make a 15 second video, put it on YouTube. "We don't estimate parameters because we care about parameters. Parameters are imaginary! Like unicorns! [Put finger on forehead and imitate unicorn.] We estimate parameters to build Data Generating Mechanisms. And with a DGM, you can move the world!" -->

<p><em>The Hunger Games</em> is a dystopian novel in which children are chosen via lottery to fight to the death. Primrose Everdeen is selected from the urn. Why does she have the misfortune of being selected? Or, as we data scientists say, <em>sampled</em>?</p>
<p>In Chapter <a href="probability.html#probability">5</a>, we learned about probability, the framework for quantifying uncertainty. In this chapter, we will learn about <em>sampling</em>, the beginning of our journey toward inference. When we sample, we take some <em>units</em> from a <em>population</em>, calculate statistics based on those units, and make inferences about unknown <em>parameters</em> associated with the population.</p>
<p>The urn below has a certain number of red and a certain number of white beads all of equal size, mixed well together. What proportion, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, of this urn’s beads are red?</p>

</div>
<p>One way to answer this question would be to perform an exhaustive count: remove each bead individually, count the number of red beads, count the number of white beads, and divide the number of red beads by the total number of beads. Call that ratio <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, the proportion of red beads in the urn. However, this would be a long and tedious process. Therefore, we will use sampling! Consider two questions:</p>
<p><em>If we get 17 red beads in a random sample of size 50 taken from the urn, what proportion <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> of the beads in the urn are red?</em></p>
<p><em>What is the probability, using that same urn, that we will draw more than 8 red beads if we use a shovel of size 20?</em></p>
<p>To begin this chapter, we will look at a real sampling activity: the urn. Then, we will simulate the urn example using R code. This will help us to understand the <em>standard error</em> and the ways in which uncertainty factors into our predictions. We then create a joint distribution of models and data for the urn example. We derive a posterior distribution from that joint distribution, and then use that posterior to answer our questions.</p>
<!-- RS: Add foreshadowing to Ch. 7, saying something like: "To try and estimate the probability distribution of a single parameter, p." Ch.7 does a good job of explaining 1 param v. 2 params, but readers should know what they are getting into. (Include this when we get into "answering the questions")-->

<p>Instead of performing an exhaustive count, let’s insert a shovel into the urn and remove <span class="math inline">\(5 \cdot 10 = 50\)</span> beads. We are taking a <em>sample</em> of the total population of beads.</p>

<p>Observe that 17 of the 50 sampled beads are red and thus 17/50 = 0.34 = 34% of the shovel’s beads are red. We can view the proportion of beads that are red in this shovel as a guess of the proportion of beads that are red in the entire urn. While not as exact as doing an exhaustive count of all the beads in the urn, our guess of 34% took much less time and energy to make.</p>
<p>Recall that <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is the true value of the proportion of red beads. There is only one <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Our guesses at the proportion of red beads are known as <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> (pronounced p hat), where <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> is the estimated value of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> which comes from taking a sample. There are many possible <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span>’s. You and I will often differ in our estimates. We each have a different <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> even though we agree that there is only one <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>Start this activity over from the beginning, placing the 50 beads back into the urn. Would a second sample include exactly 17 red beads? Maybe, but probably not.</p>
<p>What if we repeated this activity <em>many</em> times? Would our guess at the proportion of the urn’s beads that are red, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span>, be exactly 34% every time? Surely not.</p>
<p>Let’s repeat this exercise with the help of 33 groups of friends to understand how the value of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> varies across 33 independent trials.</p>

<p>For each <code>group</code>, we are given their names, the number of <code>red_beads</code> they obtained, and the corresponding proportion out of 50 beads that were red, called <code>prop_red</code>. We also have an <code>group_ID</code> variable which gives each of the 33 groups a unique identifier. Each row can be viewed as one instance of a replicated activity: using the shovel to remove 50 beads and computing the proportion of those beads that are red.</p>
<p>Let’s visualize the distribution of these 33 proportions using <code>geom_histogram()</code> with <code>binwidth = 0.05</code>. This is a computerized and complete version of the partially completed hand-drawn histogram you saw earlier. Setting <code>boundary = 0.4</code> indicates that we want a binning scheme such that one of the bins’ boundary is at 0.4. <code>color = "white"</code> modifies the color of the boundary for visual clarity.</p>

<p>What we just demonstrated in this activity is the statistical concept of <strong>sampling</strong>. We want to know the proportion of red beads in the urn, with the urn being our <strong>population</strong>. Performing an exhaustive count of the red and white beads would be time-consuming. Therefore, it is much more practical to extract a <em>sample</em> of 50 beads using the shovel. Using this sample of 50 beads, we estimated the proportion of the urn’s beads that are red to be 34%.</p>
<p>Moreover, because we mixed the beads before each use of the shovel, the samples were random and independent. Because each sample was drawn at random, the samples were different from each other. This is an example of <em>sampling variation</em>, and it is important to consider! For example, what if instead of selecting 17 beads in our first sample we had selected just 11? Does that mean that the population proportion of the beads is 11/50 or 22%? No! Because we performed 33 trials we can look to our histogram, and see that the peak of the distribution occurs when .35 &lt; <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> &lt; .4 , so it is <em>very likely</em> that the proportion of red beads in the entire population will also fall in or near this range.</p>

<p>We just performed a <em>tactile</em> sampling activity. We used a physical urn of beads and a physical shovel. We did this by hand so that we could develop our intuition about the ideas behind sampling. In this section, we mimic this physical sampling with <em>virtual</em> sampling, using a computer.</p>

<p>Observe that <code>urn</code> has 1,000 rows, meaning that the urn contains
1,000 beads. The first variable <code>bead_ID</code> is used as an <em>identification variable</em>. None of the beads in the actual urn are marked with numbers. The second variable <code>color</code> indicates whether a particular virtual bead is red or white.</p>
<p>Note that in this section, we used the variable <code>bead_ID</code> to keep track of each bead in our urn, while in the last section we used <code>group_ID</code> to keep track of the samples drawn by the 33 individual teams. This is a better strategy than naming both variables <code>ID</code>, as it would be much more likely for us to get them confused later on.</p>
<p>Our virtual urn needs a virtual shovel. We use <code>slice_sample()</code> and list-column mapping wizardry learned in Section <a href="probability.html#list-columns-and-map-functions">5.1</a> to take a sample of 50 beads from our virtual urn.</p>

<p>There are two levels. There is one row in the tibble for each sample. So far, we have only drawn one sample. Within each row, there is a second level, the tibble which is the sample. That tibble has two variables: <code>trial_ID</code> and <code>color</code>. This is the advantage to using <code>slice_sample()</code>, because it selects all columns of our urn, whereas <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/sample.html">sample()</a></code> can only sample from a single column. While identifying each individual bead could be irrelevant in our urn scenario, with other problems it could be very useful to have additional data about each individual.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that the extra data provided by <code>slice_sample()</code> comes at a cost: <em>efficiency</em>. Because most of us run R Studio on our local machines, each R variable is stored using memory on our computers. As we add more columns or more complex objects to our tibbles, they will take up more memory and become less efficient. For example, <code>slice_sample()</code> will store a tibble for each sample, while <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/sample.html">sample()</a></code> will store a list. And the difference is not negligible! We can use the handy utility function <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/object.size.html">object.size()</a></code> to know that a tibble with nothing in it takes up 736 bytes of memory, while an empty list takes up no memory. While our urn simulation takes up a relatively small amount of storage and we are not overly concerned with optimizing tibble size, it never hurts to practice making our tibbles more efficient. Before working with large data sets that may take several minutes to load, it may be helpful to read this <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/memory.html">article about memory in R</a> to make sure we understand the implications of using complex datatypes within tibbles, so we can make the most out of our future list-column mapping endeavors.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve evaluated the implications of <code>slice_sample()</code> for our tibble, let’s add a column which indicates the number of red beads in the sample taken from the shovel.</p>

<!-- RS: I think the dollar sign operator should be understood at this point, but was thinking about asking Yuhan to include a way better explanation about the "this" operator in Chapter 5.  -->

<p>How does this work? R evaluates if <code>color == red</code>, and treats <code>TRUE</code> values like the number <code>1</code> and <code>FALSE</code> values like the number <code>0</code>. So summing the number of <code>TRUE</code>s and <code>FALSE</code>s is equivalent to summing <code>1</code>’s and <code>0</code>’s. In the end, this operation counts the number of beads where <code>color</code> equals “red.”</p>
<p>Finally, calculate the proportion red by dividing <code>numb_red</code> (The number of red beads observed in the shovel), by the shovel size (We are using a shovel of size 50).</p>

<p>Careful readers will note that the <code>numb_red</code> is changing in each example above. The reason, of course, is that each block re-runs the shovel exercise, and slice_sample will return a random number of red beads. If we wanted the same number in each block, we would need to use <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Random.html">set.seed()</a></code> each time, always providing the same <code>seed</code> each time.</p>

<p>Observe that we occasionally obtained proportions red that are less than 30%. On the other hand, we occasionally obtained proportions that are greater than 45%. However, the most frequently occurring proportions were between 35% and 45%. Why do we have these differences in proportions red? Because of <em>sampling variation</em>.</p>
<p>Now we will compare our virtual results with our tactile results from the previous section. Observe that both histograms are somewhat similar in their center and variation, although not identical. These slight differences are again due to random sampling variation. Furthermore, observe that both distributions are somewhat bell-shaped.</p>

<p>Although we took 33 samples from the urn in the previous section, we should never do that again! The advantage of modern technology is that we can use virtual simulation as many times as we choose, so we have no restrictions on resources. No longer are the days where we have to recruit our friends to tirelessly sample from the physical urn. We are now data scientists! 33 samples are useless to us. Instead, we use our simulations hundreds or thousands of times to create mathematical models that we can combine with our knowledge to answer our questions. In this section we’ll examine the effects of sampling from the urn 1,000 times.</p>
<p>We can reuse our code from above, making sure to replace 33 trials with 1,000.</p>

<p>Why the empty spaces among the bars? Recall that, with only 50 beads, there are only 51 possible values for <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span>: 0, 0.02, 0.04, …, 0.98, 1. A value of 0.31 or 0.47 is impossible, hence the gaps.</p>
<p>The most frequently occurring proportions of red beads occur, again, between 35% and 45%. Every now and then we observe proportions much higher or lower. This occurs because as we increase the number of trials, tails develop on our distribution as we are more likely to witness extreme <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> values. The symmetric, bell-shaped distribution shown in the histogram is well approximated by the <em>normal distribution</em>.</p>

<p>Instead of just one shovel, imagine we have three choices of shovels to extract a sample of beads with: shovels of size 25, 50, and 100. Using our newly developed tools for virtual sampling, let’s unpack the effect of having different sample sizes. Start by creating a tibble with 1,000 rows, each row representing an instance of us sampling from the urn with our chosen shovel size. Then, compute the resulting 1,000 replicates of proportion red.

FIGURE 6.10: Comparing the distributions of proportion red for different sample sizes (25, 50, 100). The important takeaway is that our center becomes more concentrated as our sample size increases, indicating a smaller standard deviation between our guesses.
</p>
</div>
<p>Observe that as the sample size increases, the histogram becomes taller and narrower. This is because the <em>variation</em> of the proportion red for each sample decreases. Remember: A large variation means there are a wide range of values that can be achieved, while smaller variations are concentrated around a specific value.</p>
<p>Why does variation decrease as sample size increases? If we use a large sample size like 100 or 500, our sample is much more representative of the population simply because more of the population is included. As a result, the proportion red in our sample (<span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span>) will be closer to the population proportion (p). On the other hand, smaller samples have much more variation because of our old friend chance. We are much more likely to have extreme samples that are not representative of our population.</p>
<p>Let’s attempt to visualize the concept of <em>variation</em> a different way. For each sample size, let’s plot the proportion red for <em>all</em> 1,000 samples. With 3 different shovel sizes, we will have 3,000 total points, with each point representing an instance of sampling from the urn with a specific shovel size.</p>

<p>This graph illustrates the exact same concept as the histogram. With the smallest shovel size there is significant variance from sample to sample, as samples take on a wide variety of sample proportions! However, as we increase the sample size, the points become more concentrated, or less variance.</p>
<p>There is also a third way to understand variation! We can be numerically explicit about the amount of variation in our three sets of 1,000 values of <code>prop_red</code> by using the <em>standard deviation</em>. A standard deviation is a summary statistic that measures the amount of variation within a numerical variable. For all three sample sizes, let’s compute the standard deviation of the 1,000 proportions red.</p>

<p>As the sample size increases, the sample to sample variation decreases, and our guesses at the true proportion of the urn’s beads that are red get more precise. The larger the shovel, the more precise the result.</p>

<p>Let’s take a step back from all the variance. The reality is that our code needs to be <em>re-factored</em>, as it is bad practice to make a separate tibble for each sample size. To make comparisons easier, let’s attempt to put all 3 shovel sizes in the same tibble using mapping.</p>

<p>To those of us who do not completely understand mapping, do not fret! The <strong>tidyr</strong> package provides the <code>expand_grid()</code> function as a neat alternative. We can use <code>expand_grid()</code> and a new variable, <code>shovel_size</code>, to create a tibble which will organize our results. Instead of using 1,000 trials, let’s use 3 to get a feel for the function.</p>

<!-- The variation in p-hat (when we do 1,000 reps) decreases as shovel size increases. For each shovel size, you plot 1,000 points. Small shovels have lots of overlap, so, use alpha. Even big shovels only have scores of possible p-hats. Then, say, can we measure the decrease in varition more precisely then just looking at this cloud of points? Yes! Plot the standard deviation of the cloud for each shovel size. Done I think.-->

<p>This is the power of running many analyses at once using map functions and list columns: before, we could tell that the standard deviation was decreasing as the shovel size increased, but when only looking at shovel sizes of 25, 50, and 100, it wasn’t clear <em>how quickly</em> it was decreasing.</p>

<p><em>Standard errors (SE) quantify the effect of sampling variation on our estimates.</em> In other words, they quantify how much we can expect the calculated proportions of a shovel’s beads that are red <em>to vary</em> from one sample to another sample to another sample, and so on. As a general rule, as sample size increases, the standard error decreases.</p>
<p><em>The standard error is the standard deviation of a sample statistic (aka point estimate), such as the proportion.</em> For example, the <em>standard error of the mean</em> refers to the standard deviation of the distribution of sample means taken from a population.</p>
<p>The relationship between the standard error and the standard deviation is that, for a given sample size, <em>the standard error equals the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size</em>. Accordingly, the standard error is inversely proportional to the sample size. The larger the sample size, the smaller the standard error.</p>
<p>If this sounds confusing, don’t worry! It is. Before we can explain this in more depth, it is important to understand some terminology.</p>

</div>
<p>All of the concepts underlying this terminology, notation, and definitions tie directly to the concepts underlying our tactile and virtual sampling activities. It will simply take time and practice to master them.</p>
<p>First, a <strong>population</strong> is the set of relevant units. The population’s size is upper-case <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. In our sampling activities, the population is the collection of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> = 1,000 identically sized red and white beads in the urn. This is about the simplest possible population. Other examples are all the adult men in the US, all the classrooms in a school, all the wheelbarrows in Massachusetts, all the values of your blood pressure, read at five minute intervals, for your entire life. Often, the population is extends over time, as with your blood pressure readings and is, therefore, more amorphous. Consider all the people who have run for governor of a US state since 1900, or all the people who will run for governor through 2050. Those are also populations.</p>
<p>Second, a <strong>population parameter</strong> is a numerical summary quantity about the population that is unknown, but you wish you knew. For example, when this quantity is the mean, the population parameter of interest is the <em>population mean</em>. This is mathematically denoted with the Greek letter <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> pronounced “mu.” In our earlier sampling from the urn activity, however, since we were interested in the <em>proportion</em> of the urn’s beads that were red, the population parameter is the <em>population proportion</em>, denoted with <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>Third, a <strong>census</strong> is an exhaustive enumeration or counting of all <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> units in the population in order to compute the population parameter’s value <em>exactly</em>. In our sampling activity, this would correspond to counting the number of beads out of <span class="math inline">\(N = 1000\)</span> that are red and computing the <em>population proportion</em> <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> that are red <em>exactly</em>. When the number <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> of individuals or observations in our population is large as was the case with our urn, a census can be quite expensive in terms of time, energy, and money. A census is impossible for any populations which includes the future, like our blood pressure next year or candidates for governor in 2040. There is a <em>truth</em> but we could not, even in theory, calculate it.</p>
<p>Fourth, <strong>sampling</strong> is the act of collecting a sample from the population when we can not, or do not want to, perform a census. The sample size is lower case <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, as opposed to upper case <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> for the population’s size. Typically the sample size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is much smaller than the population size <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. In our sampling activities, we used shovels with varying slots to extract samples of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> = 1 through <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> = 100.</p>
<p>Fifth, a <strong>point estimate</strong>, also known as a <strong>sample statistic</strong>, is a measure computed from a sample that <em>estimates</em> an unknown population parameter. In our sampling activities, recall that the unknown population parameter was the proportion of red beads and that this is mathematically denoted with <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Our point estimate is the <em>sample proportion</em>: the proportion of the shovel’s beads that are red. In other words, it is our guess at the proportion of the urn’s beads that are red. The point estimate of the parameter <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span>. The “hat” on top of the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> indicates that it is an estimate of the unknown population proportion <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>Sixth, a sample is said to be <strong>representative</strong> if it roughly <em>looks like</em> the population. In other words, are the sample’s characteristics a good representation of the population’s characteristics? In our sampling activity, are the samples of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> beads extracted using our shovels representative of the urn’s <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> = 1000 beads?</p>
<p>Seventh, a sample is <strong>generalizable</strong> if any results based on the sample can generalize to the population. In our sampling activity, can we generalize the sample proportion from our shovels to the entire urn? Using our mathematical notation, this is akin to asking if <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> is a “good guess” of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>?</p>
<p>Eighth, <strong>biased sampling</strong> occurs if certain individuals or observations in a population have a higher chance of being included in a sample than others. We say a sampling procedure is <strong>unbiased</strong> if every observation in a population had an equal chance of being sampled. Had the red beads been much smaller than the white beads, and therefore more prone to falling out of the shovel, our sample would have been <strong>biased</strong>. In our sampling activities, since we mixed all <span class="math inline">\(N = 1000\)</span> beads prior to each group’s sampling and since each of the equally sized beads had an equal chance of being sampled, our samples were unbiased.</p>
<p>Ninth, a sampling procedure is <em>random</em> if we sample randomly from the population in an unbiased fashion. In our sampling activities, this would correspond to sufficiently mixing the urn before each use of the shovel.</p>

<p><strong>In general:</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>the sample is <strong>unbiased</strong> and <strong>representative</strong> of the population of size <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, thus</li>
<li>any result based on the sample can <strong>generalize</strong> to the population, thus</li>
<li>the point estimate is a <strong>“good guess”</strong> of the unknown population parameter, thus</li>
<li>instead of performing a <strong>census</strong>, we can draw inferences about the population using <strong>sampling</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Specific to our sampling activity:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If we extract a sample of <span class="math inline">\(n=50\)</span> beads at <strong>random</strong>, in other words, we mix all of the equally sized beads before using the shovel, then</li>
<li>the contents of the shovel are an <strong>unbiased representation</strong> of the contents of the urn’s 1000 beads, thus</li>
<li>any result based on the shovel’s beads can <strong>generalize</strong> to the urn, thus</li>
<li>the sample proportion <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> of the <span class="math inline">\(n=50\)</span> beads in the shovel that are red is a <strong>“good guess”</strong> of the population proportion <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> of the <span class="math inline">\(N=1000\)</span> beads that are red, thus</li>
<li>instead of manually going over all 1,000 beads in the urn, we can make <strong>inferences</strong> about the urn by using the results from the shovel.</li>

<p>Now, for some important statistical definitions related to sampling. As a refresher of our 1,000 repeated/replicated virtual samples of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> = 25, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> = 50, and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> = 100 in Section <a href="one-parameter.html#virtual-sampling">6.2</a>, let’s display our figure showing the difference in proportions red according to different shovel sizes.</p>
<div class="figure">
<span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-503"></span>
<img src="book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-503-1.png" alt="Previously seen three distributions of the sample proportion $\hat{p}$." width="100%"><p class="caption">
FIGURE 6.17: Previously seen three distributions of the sample proportion <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span>.
</p>
</div>
<p>These types of distributions have a special name: <strong>sampling distributions</strong>; their visualization displays the effect of sampling variation on the distribution of a point estimate; in this case, the sample proportion <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span>. Using these sampling distributions, for a given sample size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, we can make statements about what values we typically expect.</p>
<p>For example, observe the centers of all three sampling distributions: they are all roughly centered around <span class="math inline">\(0.4 = 40\%\)</span>. Furthermore, observe that while we are somewhat likely to observe sample proportions of red beads of <span class="math inline">\(0.2 = 20\%\)</span> when using the shovel with 25 slots, we will almost never observe a proportion of 20% when using the shovel with 100 slots. Observe also the effect of sample size on the sampling variation. As the sample size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> increases from 25 to 50 to 100, the variation of the sampling distribution decreases and thus the values cluster more and more tightly around the same center of around 40%. We quantified this variation using the standard deviation of our sample proportions, seeing that the standard deviation decreases with the square root of the sample size:</p>
<div class="figure">
<span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-504"></span>
<img src="book_temp_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-504-1.png" alt="Previously seen comparing standard deviations of proportions red for 100 different shovels" width="100%"><p class="caption">
FIGURE 6.18: Previously seen comparing standard deviations of proportions red for 100 different shovels
</p>
</div>
<p>So as the sample size increases, the standard deviation of the proportion of red beads decreases. This type of standard deviation has another special name: <strong>standard error</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-a-standard-error" class="section level3" number="6.3.3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">6.3.3</span> What is a “standard error?”<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-a-standard-error"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The “standard error” (SE) is a term that measures the accuracy with which a sample distribution represents a population through the use of standard deviation. Specifically, SE is used to refer to the standard deviation of a sample statistic (aka point estimate), such as the mean or median. For example, the “standard error of the mean” refers to the standard deviation of the distribution of sample means taken from a population.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In statistics, a sample mean deviates from the actual mean of a population; this deviation is the standard error of the mean.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many students struggle to differentiate the standard error from the standard deviation. The relationship between the standard error and the standard deviation is such that, for a given sample size, the standard error equals the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. Accordingly, the standard error is inversely proportional to the sample size; the larger the sample size, the smaller the standard error because the statistic will approach the actual value.</p>
<!-- Insert visual aid for students who are not mathematically inclined showing that larger sample sizes = closer to actual value -->
<p>The more data points involved in the calculations of the mean, the smaller the standard error tends to be. When the standard error is small, the data is said to be more representative of the true mean. In cases where the standard error is large, the data may have some notable irregularities. Thus, larger sample size = smaller standard error = more representative of the truth.</p>
<p>To help reinforce these concepts, let’s re-display our previous figure but using our new sampling terminology, notation, and definitions:</p>

<p>Furthermore, let’s display the graph of standard errors for <span class="math inline">\(n = 1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(n = 100\)</span> using our new terminology, notation, and definitions relating to sampling.</p>

<p>Remember the key message of this last table: that as the sample size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> goes up, the “typical” error of your point estimate will go down, as quantified by the <em>standard error</em>.</p>

<p>If we could only know two pieces of information from our data, what would they be? First, you need a measure of the <strong>center</strong> of the distribution. This would include the mean or median, which shows the center of our data points. Second, we need a measure of the <strong>variability</strong> of the distribution. To understand our center, we must understand how different (or how spread) our data points are from one another. Thus, we need a measure like sd() or MAD. These are summary statistics which are necessary to understanding a distribution. Do those two figures encompass all you need to know about a distribution? No! But, if you are only allowed two numbers to keep, those are the most valuable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mean or median is a good estimate for the center of the posterior and the standard error or mad is a good estimate for the variability of the posterior, with +/- 2 standard errors covering 95% of the outcomes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The standard error measures the accuracy of a sample distribution as compared to the population by using the standard deviation. Specifically, the standard deviation of our data points divided by the square root of the sample size. As such, we find that larger sample sizes = lower standard errors = more accurate and representative guesses.</p>
<p>To really drive home our point: standard error is just a fancy term for your uncertainty about something you don’t know. Standard error == our (uncertain) beliefs.</p>

<!-- RS: Pyramid is not super helpful and I support removing it and all references to it.  -->
<p>This hierarchy represents the knowledge we need to understand standard error (SE). At the bottom, we have math. It’s the foundation for our understanding, but it doesn’t need to be what we take away from this lesson. As we go up, we simplify the topic. The top of the pyramid are the basic levels of understanding that will help you to remember in the future.</p>
<p>If I know your estimate plus or minus <em>two</em> standard errors, I know your 95% confidence interval. This is valuable information. Standard error is really just a measure for how uncertain we are about something we do not know, the thing we are estimating. When we recall SE, we should remember that, all in all, it’s a complicated concept that can be distilled into: the way old people talk about confidence intervals.</p>
<!-- RS: Explain what confidence interval is.  -->
<p>Recall that <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> is the estimated value of p which comes from taking a sample. There can be billions and billions of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span>’s. We look at a large group of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span>’s, create a distribution of results to represent the possible values of p based on our findings, and then we compute a standard error to account for our own uncertainty about our predictions. Our 95% confidence interval for our prediction == our estimate plus or minus <strong>two</strong> standard errors.</p>
<p>In regards to the fifth layer of the hierarchy, we may wonder:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I thought that MADs were the same thing as standard deviations. Now you say they are the same things as standard errors. Which is it?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>MADs and standard deviations are, more or less, the same thing. They are both measures of the <strong>variability</strong> of a distribution. In most cases, they have very similar values. A <em>standard error</em> is also a standard deviation. Specifically, it is the standard deviation of the distribution of the estimates, and that distribution of estimates is, more or less, your posterior. Therefore, we can use MAD, like standard error, to describe that distribution and the variability of that distribution.</p>

<p><em>If we get 17 red beads in a random sample of size 50 taken from an urn, what proportion <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> of the beads in the urn are red?</em></p>
<p><em>What is the probability, using the same urn, that we will draw more than 8 red beads if we use a shovel of size 20?</em></p>
<p>We have looked at a number of different models and their accuracy and precision. To delve into our primary questions, we must return to our discussion of distributions: posterior, joint, and marginal.</p>
<div id="joint-distribution" class="section level3" number="6.4.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">6.4.1</span> Joint distribution<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#joint-distribution"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Let’s start with our first question: <strong>If we get 17 red beads in a random sample of size 50 taken from an urn with 1000 (white or red) beads, how many red beads are in the urn?</strong></p>
<p>In Chapter <a href="probability.html#probability">5</a> we outlined the key intuition behind all inference: there is a joint distribution of data-which-we-might-see-from-our-experiment and models-which-we-are-considering. We take this joint distribution, combine it with the actual results of the experiment, and calculate a posterior distribution over the set of possible models. In other words, we start with</p>
<!-- RS: Not a huge fan of this definition of joint distribution. Chapter 5 has a much better one.  -->
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Prob}(\text{models}, \text{data})\]</span></p>
<p>We then add the specific results of the experiment, and calculate the conditional distribution of the models, given the data that we have seen:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Prob}(\text{models} | \text{data} = \text{results of experiment})\]</span></p>
<p>The rest is just details.</p>
<p>We can do the same thing with our sampling problem. Assume that we know that there are 1,000 beads in the urn, and that all of them are either red or white. Our experiment involves the one-time use of a shovel with 50 slots. We have 1,001 models under consideration. There might be zero red beads or one red bead or … 999 red beads or 1000 red beads. With a shovel of size 50, there are 51 possible results from our experiment: zero red beads or one red bead or . . . or 49 red beads or 50 red beads. With this information we can calculate <em>the joint distribution of models which we are considering and the experiment results we might observe.</em> Once we have that joint distribution, we can calculate the conditional distribution of the total number of red beads, given however many we observed in our sample.</p>
<p>It is useful to define a parameter, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, which is the proportion of red beads in the urn. This also takes on exactly 1,001 possible values: <span class="math inline">\(0, 1/1000, 2/1000, ..., 999/1000, 1\)</span>. With these assumptions, we can create an unnormalized joint distribution:</p>
<!-- Note to future authors: I am somewhat concerned that this is not exactly correct since we really ought to sample what happens when you pick 50 beads out of an urn. This can be approximated with the binomial, which is what we have done here. And, with such big numbers, it is a good approximation. But it is not exactly correct. Fixed-->

<!-- It is easiest to define our "model" in this joint distribution in terms of the unknown parameter $p$ rather than in terms of the unknown number of red beads in the urn. If we plotted the number of read beads in the urn, our model would only be applicable to the 1,000 bead urn. By using $p$, we can model the likelihood of drawing our sample from any size urn, because $p$ is normalized. We can always go back and multiply $p$ by the population size to get the number of red beads in the population if we want.  -->

</div>
<p>To visualize this in a 3D plot, see the slice in the figure below. There are a few things to note. First, the x-axis only extends to 600 (rather than the total 1000) due to the fact that, when the shovel only draws 17/50 = .34 = 34% red beads, it is almost impossible for the total number red beads in the total urn to exceed 600. The most likely number of red beads in the total urn, when the shovel draws 17/50 red beads, is somewhere in the 290-350 range. This is signified by the peak between these points. The probability is lower below 280 and above 350 because it is less likely that this is the number of red beads in the urn, conditional on the fact that the shovel drew 17/50 red beads. This is our posterior distribution.</p>
<p>For any value of red beads found in the shovel (from 0 to 50), there is a posterior distribution of possible values of red beads in the total urn. This distribution is meant to illustrate that, though our sample gives an estimate of the total proportion of red beads in the entire urn, there is much variation in what the actual proportion might be. To summarize: the distribution of the hat things (the things we are predicting) is, more or less, your posterior.</p>
<p>Recall the first question from the start of the Chapter:</p>
<p><em>If we get 17 red beads in a random sample of size 50 taken from an urn, what proportion <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> of the beads in the urn are red?</em></p>
<p>The answer is not a single number. Our posterior distribution is just that: a distribution. From our sample, we have many different results for the proportion of red beads in the entire urn. Certain proportions, like the extremes close to 0% or 100%, are essentially impossible due to our sample value being 32%. Some sample proportions, like 40%, occur far more frequently than other sample proportions.</p>
<p>This means that, while we can provide a range of possibilities (and we can estimate which of those possibilities occur most frequently), we can never say that we know the total number of red beads with certainty.</p>
<p>The key issue with the urn paradigm is that, unlike real world data science, we <em>can</em> technically find the true proportion. We just have to perform that exhaustive count that we’ve been so desperately avoiding. In the real world, the “true” solution can never be known. This is why we require inference, and why tools like sampling are so helpful for drawing conclusions about the world around us.</p>
<!-- DK: Could use rayshader to make the posterior, or even to do a movie, as we hope to do in Chapter 5 someday. Also, should note that we are approaching the continuous case as the number of models and number of possible data results become ever larger.  -->

<!-- RS: I would reword this section a little bit, and make it explicitly clear where the BAD hypothesis testing begins and the GOOD sumarization begins. Maybe create 6.4.3.1 and 6.4.3.2-->
<p>Recall our view on hypothesis tests: <strong>Amateurs test. Professionals summarize.</strong> Traditionally, most scientific papers are not so much interested in estimating p. They are interested in testing specific hypotheses. What do we mean by that?</p>
<p>Let’s look at a possible hypothesis in our urn paradigm: there are equal number of red and white beads in the urn. The null hypothesis is denoted by <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>, while the alternative hypothesis is denoted by <span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span>. Therefore, our hypothesis is designed as such:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>: There are an equal number of red and white beads in the urn.
<span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span>: There are <em>not</em> an equal number of red and white beads in the urn.</p>
<p>Can we reject that hypothesis? Convention: if the 95% confidence interval excludes the null hypothesis, then we reject it. Here, that would mean if our posterior estimate (plus or minus 2 standard errors) <em>excluded</em> the possibility of the red and white beads being equal, translating into a proportion red of 50%, we can reject the null hypothesis. Otherwise, we don’t reject it. However, this does not mean that we accept it. More to the point: rejecting or not rejecting hypotheses doesn’t helps us to answer real questions. There is no reason to <strong>test</strong> when you can summarize by providing the full posterior probability distribution, as we will do below.</p>
<p>The same arguments apply in the case of “insignificant” results, with p &gt; 0.5, when we can’t “reject” the null hypothesis. The fact that a difference is not “significant” has no relevance to how we use the posterior to make decisions. The same reasoning applies to every parameter we estimate, to every prediction we make. Never test — unless your boss demands a test. <strong>Use your judgment, make your models, summarize your knowledge of the world, and use that summary to make decisions.</strong> In the next section, we will create our posterior distribution and use this posterior to predict outcomes.</p>

<p>Now that we have our posterior distribution for the proportion <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> of red beads in the urn, we can use that object to forecast other outcomes, outcomes which we have not yet observed. Recall, from the start of the Chapter:</p>
<p><em>Conditional on our answer to Question 1, what is the probability, using the same urn, that we will draw more than 8 red beads if we use a shovel of size 20?</em></p>
<p>We need to create an (unnormalized) posterior distribution for the number of red beads in a new draw with a 20-slot shovel.</p>

<!-- RS: Need to make it more clear that the 17 goes from the data in our joint distribution from the previous question.  -->
<!-- RS: Also, shouldn't the number of trials (n in rbinom) be greater than 1? Don't we want to do multiple trials for each potential p? I think using this rbinom is falsely saying that for a given p, the number of red beads drawn WILL be ____ . It could be that, but there would also be many other possiblities of red beads drawn. I feel we should make another joint distribution and take the posterior distribution from that, but this is all kind of confusing and I could be totaly wrong. -->
<p>Note that we have two columns to focus on after removing the columns <code>red_in_urn</code> and <code>red_in_shovel</code>. The column <code>p</code> represents our probability for the number of red beads we draw with our shovel size of 20 (conditional upon a previous draw of 17 red beads). The column <code>new_reds</code> represents the number of red beads found in our draw of twenty beads with the corresponding value for <code>p</code>. Scroll through our object to look at the probabilities for various results of <code>new_reds</code>.</p>
<p>With this unnormalized distribution, it is easy to create the normalized posterior probability distribution.</p>

<p>The answer is about 25%. To observe this visually, take a look at the <code>post_dist</code> object when we filter for where the number of red beads is equal to and greater than 8. The answer above measures the area under <em>this</em> portion of the curve as compared to the <em>entire</em> area under the curve. <em>Each question requires looking at a new area under the curve.</em> When someones asks you a question, they are doing two things. First, they are providing instructions as to the posterior your should create. Here, the results with a shovel of 20 slots. Second, they are asking a question about the area under the curve in a specific region. Here, the region where the number of red beads is greater than 8 is highlighted in red. Therefore, the area below the curve that <strong>is red</strong> is how we get our estimate.</p>

</h3>
<!-- RS: I like the cardinal virtues motif, and I think we could implement something cool wherever they appear throughout the primer. I don't have any ideas right now, but maybe someone can think of something cool.  -->
<p>Recall the virtue of Wisdom. We want to know if there is a decent connection between the problem we face and the data we have. Our problem is answering the following question: <em>Conditional on our answer to Question 1, what is the probability, using the same urn, that we will draw more than 8 red beads if we use a shovel of size 20?</em> The way in which we have approached answering this question is to, from our posterior distribution from our urn, create a joint distribution to estimate the probability of drawing more than 8 red beads with a shovel of size 20. Is this question about <em>this</em> particular urn, or all urns? Clearly, as it is conditional upon a result from our specific urn, our conclusions can only be applied to <em>this particular urn</em>; our conclusions are not generalizable to all urns.</p>
<p>Justice encompasses two main topics that apply to our urn: predictive versus causal model and mathematical formulas. Are we are modeling (just) for prediction or are we (also) modeling for causation? Predictive models care nothing about causation. With prediction, all we care about is forecasting Y given X on some as-yet-unseen data. There is no notion of “manipulation” in such models. As we can see, then, our model is <strong>predictive</strong>; we are not manipulating anything. The math of our model can be:
<span class="math display">\[ T_i  \sim B(p_H, n = 20) \]</span>
The total number <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> of red beads in experiment <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> with 20 sampled beads, <span class="math inline">\(T_i\)</span>, is distributed as a binomial with <span class="math inline">\(n = 20\)</span> and an unknown probability <span class="math inline">\(\rho_h\)</span> of the proportion red exceeding 8 out of 20 beads.</p>
<p>Courage focuses on code – the structure of our model. Code allows us to “fit” a model by estimating the values of the unknown parameters. Though we can never know the true values of these parameters, we can express our uncertain knowledge in the form of posterior probability distributions. With those distributions, we can compare the actual values of the outcome variable with the “fitted” or “predicted” results of the model. We can examine the “residuals,” the difference between the fitted and actual values. To answer our question, we have taken a slice of our posterior distribution to create a joint distribution. To find our final solution, we looked at the area under the curve that includes all values of 8 red beads or above.
<!-- RS: Kind of confused about the vocab. Didn't we go from joint to posterior probability to another posterior probability? Also I mentioned this earlier but shouldn't we create another joint distribution with p and phat? -->
When we think of Temperance, we should think of uncertainty. Asserting a posterior distribution is, conceptually, the same as opening a casino and allowing people to place wagers on outcomes, with the odds consistent with your posterior. If your posterior is wrong, they will take all your money. That would be bad! So, what do we do? Rule of thumb: the future is always more variable than our models would suggest. The entire point of the virtue of Temperance to be aware of that fact and take account of it. Courage — that bold bastard — comes along and says, “Here is the model! Let’s calculate the posterior and open the casino!” Temperance says, “Hold on! Yes, I can calculate the posterior, but we need to be cautious.” Temperance is concerned with the tails of our predictions, not the center. What is the best strategy for opening our casino, then? Limit the bets on the first few nights to make sure our posterior is OK. <em>Temperance is concerned with the sensible management of the casino.</em></p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">6.5.2</span> Case study: Polls<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sampling-case-study"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Let’s now switch gears to a more realistic sampling scenario: a poll. In practice, pollsters do not take 1,000 repeated samples as we did in our previous sampling activities, but rather take only a <em>single sample</em> that’s as large as possible.</p>
<p>On December 4, 2013, National Public Radio in the US reported on a poll of President Obama’s approval rating among young Americans aged 18-29 in an article, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2013/12/04/248793753/poll-support-for-obama-among-young-americans-eroding">“Poll: Support For Obama Among Young Americans Eroding.”</a> The poll was conducted by the Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics at Harvard University. A quote from the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After voting for him in large numbers in 2008 and 2012, young Americans are souring on President Obama.</p>
<p>According to a new Harvard University Institute of Politics poll, just 41 percent of millennials — adults ages 18-29 — approve of Obama’s job performance, his lowest-ever standing among the group and an 11-point drop from April.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s tie elements of the real life poll in this new article with our “tactile” and “virtual” urn activity from Sections <a href="one-parameter.html#sampling-activity">6.1</a> and <a href="one-parameter.html#virtual-sampling">6.2</a> using the terminology, notations, and definitions we learned in Section <a href="one-parameter.html#standard-errors">6.3</a>. You’ll see that our sampling activity with the urn is an idealized version of what pollsters are trying to do in real life.
<!-- RS: I love the way this section uses the vocabulary, and I think this should be replicated everywhere else in the chapter. Very helpful to see the meaning of each word in practice. Maybe add mention to the first cardinal value when setting up the problem to really teach the concept? -->
First, who is the <strong>(Study) Population</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> individuals or observations of interest?</p>
<ul>
<li>Urn: <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> = 1000 identically sized red and white beads</li>
<li>Obama poll: <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> = ? young Americans aged 18-29</li>
</ul>
<p>Second, what is the <strong>population parameter</strong>?</p>
<ul>
<li>Urn: The population proportion <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> of <em>all</em> the beads in the urn that are red.</li>
<li>Obama poll: The population proportion <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> of <em>all</em> young Americans who approve of Obama’s job performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Third, what would a <strong>census</strong> look like?</p>
<ul>
<li>Urn: Manually going over all <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> = 1000 beads and exactly computing the population proportion <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> of the beads that are red.</li>
<li>Obama poll: Locating all <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> young Americans and asking them all if they approve of Obama’s job performance. In this case, we don’t even know what the population size <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is!</li>
</ul>
<p>Fourth, how do you perform <strong>sampling</strong> to obtain a sample of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>?</p>
<ul>
<li>Urn: Using a shovel with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> slots.</li>
<li>Obama poll: One method is to get a list of phone numbers of all young Americans and pick out <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> phone numbers. In this poll’s case, the sample size of this poll was <span class="math inline">\(n = 2089\)</span> young Americans.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fifth, what is your <strong>point estimate (AKA sample statistic)</strong> of the unknown population parameter?</p>
<ul>
<li>Urn: The sample proportion <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> of the beads in the shovel that were red.</li>
<li>Obama poll: The sample proportion <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> of young Americans in the sample that approve of Obama’s job performance. In this poll’s case, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p} = 0.41 = 41\%\)</span>, the quoted percentage in the second paragraph of the article.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sixth, is the sampling procedure <strong>representative</strong>?</p>
<ul>
<li>Urn: Are the contents of the shovel representative of the contents of the urn? Because we mixed the urn before sampling, we can feel confident that they are.</li>
<li>Obama poll: Is the sample of <span class="math inline">\(n = 2089\)</span> young Americans representative of <em>all</em> young Americans aged 18-29? This depends on whether the sampling was random.</li>
</ul>
<!-- RS: Also describe the differences between the real urn and the virtual urn, and that the virtual urn is much simpler than real life because the samples are truly random. --><p>Seventh, are the samples <strong>generalizable</strong> to the greater population?</p>
<ul>
<li>Urn: Is the sample proportion <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> of the shovel’s beads that are red a “good guess” of the population proportion <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> of the urn’s beads that are red? Given that the sample was representative, the answer is yes.</li>
<li>Obama poll: Is the sample proportion <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p} = 0.41\)</span> of the sample of young Americans who supported Obama a “good guess” of the population proportion <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> of all young Americans who supported Obama at this time in 2013? In other words, can we confidently say that roughly 41% of <em>all</em> young Americans approved of Obama at the time of the poll? Again, this depends on whether the sampling was random.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eighth, is the sampling procedure <strong>unbiased</strong>? In other words, do all observations have an equal chance of being included in the sample?</p>
<ul>
<li>Urn: Since each bead was equally sized and we mixed the urn before using the shovel, each bead had an equal chance of being included in a sample and hence the sampling was unbiased.</li>
<li>Obama poll: Did all young Americans have an equal chance at being represented in this poll? Again, this depends on whether the sampling was random.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ninth and lastly, was the sampling done at <strong>random</strong>?</p>
<ul>
<li>Urn: As long as you mixed the urn sufficiently before sampling, your samples would be random.</li>
<li>Obama poll: Was the sample conducted at random? We can’t answer this question without knowing about the <em>sampling methodology</em> used by Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics at Harvard University. We’ll discuss this more at the end of this section.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, the poll by Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics at Harvard University can be thought of as <em>an instance</em> of using the shovel to sample beads from the urn. Furthermore, if another polling company conducted a similar poll of young Americans at roughly the same time, they would likely get a different estimate than 41%. This is due to <em>sampling variation</em>.</p>
<p>Let’s now revisit the sampling paradigm from Subsection <a href="one-parameter.html#terminology-and-notation">6.3.1</a>:</p>
<p><strong>In general</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the sampling of a sample of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is done at <strong>random</strong>, then</li>
<li>the sample is <strong>unbiased</strong> and <strong>representative</strong> of the population of size <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, thus</li>
<li>any result based on the sample can <strong>generalize</strong> to the population, thus</li>
<li>the point estimate is a <strong>“good guess”</strong> of the unknown population parameter, thus</li>
<li>instead of performing a census, we can <strong>infer</strong> about the population using sampling.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Specific to the urn:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If we extract a sample of <span class="math inline">\(n = 50\)</span> beads at <strong>random</strong>, in other words, we mix all of the equally sized beads before using the shovel, then</li>
<li>the contents of the shovel are an <strong>unbiased representation</strong> of the contents of the urn’s 1000 beads, thus</li>
<li>any result based on the shovel’s beads can <strong>generalize</strong> to the urn, thus</li>
<li>the sample proportion <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> of the <span class="math inline">\(n = 50\)</span> beads in the shovel that are red is a <strong>“good guess”</strong> of the population proportion <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> of the <span class="math inline">\(N = 1000\)</span> beads that are red, thus</li>
<li>instead of manually going over all 1000 beads in the urn, we can <strong>infer</strong> about the urn using the shovel.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Specific to the Obama poll:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If we had a way of contacting a <strong>randomly</strong> chosen sample of 2089 young Americans and polling their approval of President Obama in 2013, then</li>
<li>these 2089 young Americans would be an <strong>unbiased</strong> and <strong>representative</strong> sample of <em>all</em> young Americans in 2013, thus</li>
<li>any results based on this sample of 2089 young Americans can <strong>generalize</strong> to the entire population of <em>all</em> young Americans in 2013, thus</li>
<li>the reported sample approval rating of 41% of these 2089 young Americans is a <strong>good guess</strong> of the true approval rating among all young Americans in 2013, thus</li>
<li>instead of performing an expensive census of all young Americans in 2013, we can <strong>infer</strong> about all young Americans in 2013 using polling.</li>
</ul>
<p>So as you can see, it was critical for the sample obtained by Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics at Harvard University to be truly random in order to infer about <em>all</em> young Americans’ opinions about Obama. Was their sample truly random? It’s hard to answer such questions without knowing about the <em>sampling methodology</em> they used.</p>
<p>For example, what if Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics at Harvard University conducted this poll using only mobile phone numbers? People without mobile phones would be left out and therefore not represented in the sample. This flaw is an example of <strong>censoring</strong>, the exclusion of certain datapoints due to an issue with data collection. This results in an incomplete observation and increases the prediction uncertainty of the estimand, Obama’s approval rating among young Americans. Ensuring that our samples were random was easy to do in our sampling urn exercises; however, in a real life situation like the Obama poll, this is much harder to do.</p>
<p>What you have visualized in this chapter was a demonstration of a famous theorem, or mathematically proven truth, called the <em>Central Limit Theorem</em>. It loosely states that when sample means are based on larger and larger sample sizes, the sampling distribution of these sample means becomes both more and more normally shaped and more and more narrow. In other words, the sampling distribution increasingly follows a <em>normal distribution</em> and the variation of these sampling distributions gets smaller, as quantified by their standard errors.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">6.5.3</span> Sampling Mechanism<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sampling-mechanism"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>One of the most important aspects of sampling is the <strong>sampling mechanism</strong>: the mechanism through which we sample our population. This concept is related, but distinctly different, from the <strong>assignment mechanism</strong> that we learned about in Chapter 3.</p>
<p>The assignment mechanism sorts units into control and experiment groups, while the sampling mechanism is the means through which we acquire our sample. Assignment mechanisms do not have a place in our urn paradigm since we are not measuring any causal relationship or assigning beads to specific groups.</p>
<p>To think about the sampling mechanism further: why are certain beads sampled, while others are not? Is this completely random?</p>
<p>In order to investigate this concept, let’s revisit our Preceptor Tables.
<!-- RS: I definetly support further exploring the Kennedy study further in this chapter, or in the tutorial because I feel like it would be much more informative than redoing the urn problem.  --></p>
<!-- RS: Consider a brief section about observational study design? I know this isn't a stats class, but might be useful to at least discuss bad sampling methods (volunteer surveys, convienence, and other types of biases. ) -->

<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">6.5.3.1</span> Preceptor Tables<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#preceptor-tables-1"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Recall that a Preceptor Table is a table with rows and columns for all the data we would (reasonably) like to have. There are two different types of Preceptor Tables that are applicable to our urn example: actual and ideal.</p>
<div class="figure">
<span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-518"></span>

FIGURE 6.22: When you see another Precetor Table section.
</p>
</div>
<p>An actual Preceptor Table shows what we <em>actually</em> know. Accordingly, the table is riddled with question marks that the real world saddles us with. The ideal Preceptor Table is the Preceptor Table with no question marks, and a reasonable number of rows and columns. With an ideal Preceptor Table, there is no need for inference; the estimand is a simple matter of arithmetic.</p>
<p>To visualize the different Preceptor Tables and their usefulness to us data scientists, let’s revisit our urn.</p>
<p>As is the case in the Rubin Causal Model, we <em>wish</em> we knew the values for every single unit in every possible scenario. The analogous ideal here would be a table where we know the color identity of every single bead. To compare to our previous Preceptor Table, this is what our ideal Preceptor Table would look like:</p>

<p>We can create the ideal Preceptor Table by performing the exhaustive census of the entire urn. Let’s say that, after this tedious process, we find that the <strong>true</strong> and <strong>real</strong> proportion of red beads is exactly 40%. We know the color of every bead.</p>
<p>In this world, the estimand, the proportion of red beads in the urn, is a simple matter of arithmetic. However, as has been emphasized before, performing an exhaustive count is not the easiest way to estimate the proportion of red beads. Real life sampling is far more complex. The process is <strong>extremely</strong> prone to error. Despite that, most people overestimate the validity of conclusions drawn from sampling. To stress the unknowns in sampling, let’s look at our actual Preceptor Table.</p>
<p>Let’s imagine we use our shovel and sample 100 beads from the urn. After taking our sample, we find that 40% of the <em>sampled</em> beads are red. Let’s visualize this by looking at the entire urn after we have taken our sample. This is an actual Preceptor Table. We only know the colors of our randomly sampled 100 beads, the remaining bead colors are our missing data!</p>

<p>Where is all of our data? Well, when we take a sample of 100 beads, we only have color identifications for 100 of the total 1000 beads in the urn. The rest of the beads were not sampled and we cannot say for certain whether they are white or red.</p>
<p>Something else we must consider is why some beads <strong>do</strong> get sampled, while others do not. This is a consequence of the sampling mechanism. Because we are drawing the sample using a shovel with 100 slots, we only have 100 known values. Therefore, our shovel (in addition to mixing the urn beforehand) is our sampling mechanism.</p>
<p>Consider this: what does this information tell us, specifically, about Bead 1? Bead 2? We know the proportion of red beads in our sample is 40%. Does this mean that bead 1 has <em>precisely</em> a 40% chance of being red? As we learned in Chapter 5, this is not true! There is uncertainty.</p>
<p>We can only claim <em>for certain</em> that, of the 100 beads that we sampled (of the total 1000 beads in the urn), 40% were red. If we were making a prediction of the probability of one of our <strong>sampled</strong> beads being red, 40% would be the correct probability. If we were making a prediction of the probability that an <strong>unsampled</strong> bead was red, the answer of 40% would be incorrect, but nor is it likely to be extremely incorrect. The sample does tell us something.</p>

<p>We saw in a previous section that as our sample size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> increases, our point estimates will vary less and less and be more and more concentrated around the true population parameter. This variation is quantified by the decreasing <em>standard error</em>. In other words, the typical error of your point estimates will decrease. In our sampling exercise, as the sample size increased, the variation of our sample proportions <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> decreased. This is also known as having a <em>precise</em> estimate.</p>
<p>So random sampling ensures our point estimates are <em>accurate</em>, while on the other hand having a large sample size ensures our point estimates are <em>precise</em>. While the terms “accuracy” and “precision” may sound like they mean the same thing, there is a subtle difference. Accuracy describes how “on target” our estimates are, whereas precision describes how “consistent” our estimates are. The image below illustrates the difference.</p>

<p>Now, it’s obvious that the best case scenario is the most precise and the most accurate option. However, real life sampling isn’t so easy!</p>
<p>What if we had the option to use a shovel with <strong>200</strong> slots, but it had a minor magnetic property that caused it to pick up slightly more red beads than the 100 slotted shovel? On one hand, the larger shovel gives us increased precision due to a larger sample size. On the other, its magnetic property gives us decreased accuracy due to a sampling bias. Here, as is often the case in the real world, there is a tradeoff!</p>

<p>To apply this to a more complex example than an urn, imagine we are conducting a poll to gather information on whether Harvard students prefer El Jefe’s Taqueria or Felipe’s Taqueria. We are given two options: 1) we can conduct the poll on 50 students walking out of Lamont Library or 2) we can conduct the poll on 300 students walking outside of El Jefe’s Taqueria.</p>
<p>The first scenario provides a more accurate estimate, since the students outside of Lamont Library are much less likely to be a biased sample. The second scenario, however, provides a more precise estimate due to the larger sample size. Even though the students <strong>outside</strong> of El Jefe’s might not be patrons, it is safe to assume that at least some will be patrons, making our sample somewhat biased. What is the better option? It depends on your views of the trade-offs between accuracy and precision. The more that precision matters, the more you should prefer the larger sample.</p>

<p>Key lesson:</p>
<p>There is a truth! There is a true value for <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> which we do not know! We want to create a posterior probability distribution which summarizes our knowledge. We care about the posterior probability distribution of p. The center of that distribution is around the mean or median of the proportion in your sample. The sd (or mad) of that posterior is the standard deviation divided by the square root of our sample size! Note that this is the same thing as the standard deviation of the repeated samples.
<!-- RS: I think there is a typo? I think standard error is intended, not standard deviation.  -->
Key lesson:</p>
<p>We have a journey from reality, to our predictions, to the standard error of our predictions, to the posterior probability distribution for p. This is our sequence:</p>
<p><strong>p (the truth) <span class="math inline">\(\Rightarrow\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> (my estimate) <span class="math inline">\(\Rightarrow\)</span> the standard error of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> (black box of math mumbo jumbo and computer simulation magic) <span class="math inline">\(\Rightarrow\)</span> our posterior probability distribution for p (our beliefs about the truth).</strong></p>
<p>This journey shows how our beliefs about the truth develop through our work. We begin with p; p is the truth, the true but unknown value we are estimating. <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> is our estimate for p. There can be millions and millions of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span>’s. Next, we must take the standard error of our estimates (our <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span>’s) to account for our uncertainty with our predictions. Finally – the thing we need most – we create a posterior probability distribution for p. This distribution is used to answer key questions about p. </p>

<ul>
<li>Sampling allows us to make guesses at an unknown, difficult-to-obtain value by looking at a smaller subset of data and generalizing it to the larger population.</li>
<li>Sampling is preferable in the urn example because counting out 1000 beads from an urn is intensive and tedious.</li>
<li>Sampling is preferable in the real-world because it is often impossible to sample “all the beads” (all the people) in a population. With sampling, you see variations in your results. This is known as sampling variation and is expected, especially if you draw samples at random (unbiased).</li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li>By creating a virtual analog of our urn and our shovel, we were able to look at <em>even more</em> samples and observe the effects of sampling size on our results.</li>
<li>More samples yield more even distributions which should resemble a bell.</li>
<li>Larger sample sizes decrease standard deviation, meaning that the resulting proportions red are closer to one another than when the sample sizes are smaller. This means that larger samples = lower SD = more precise guesses.</li>
<li>When we are writing a lot of code for something we want to perform frequently, write a function instead! This saves time and functions can be called within <code>map()</code> for more ease when plotting results.</li>

<ul>
<li>Standard error is just a fancy term for your uncertainty about something you don’t know. Standard error <span class="math inline">\(\approx\)</span> our (uncertain) beliefs.</li>
<li>The standard error measures the accuracy of a sample distribution as compared to the population by using the standard deviation.</li>
<li>We find that larger sample sizes <span class="math inline">\(\implies\)</span> lower standard errors <span class="math inline">\(\implies\)</span> more accurate estimates.<br>
</li>
<li>If we could only know two pieces of information from our data, we would need a measure of the <strong>center</strong> of the distribution (like mean or median) and a measure of the <strong>variability</strong> of the distribution (like sd or MAD).</li>
<li>SE refers to the standard deviation of a sample statistic (aka point estimate), such as the mean or median. Therefore, the “standard error of the mean” refers to the standard deviation of the distribution of sample means taken from a population.</li>

<code><a href="https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/reference/stan_glm.html">stan_glm()</a></code> can create a joint distribution and then estimate the posterior probability distribution, conditional on the data which was passed in to the data argument. This is a much easier way to create the posterior distribution, and will be explored in more detail in Chapter <a href="two-parameters.html#two-parameters">7</a>.</li>
<li>The sampling mechanism is responsible for which items/beads/people/etc are selected to be sampled. In the urn example, the <em>sampling mechanism</em> is the shovel.</li>
<li>Random sampling ensures that our point estimates are <strong>accurate</strong>, while having a large sample size ensures that our estimates are <strong>precise</strong>. The difference between precision and accuracy is important if we are to make informed estimates.</li>
<li>Real life sampling is <em>extremely</em> prone to error. This cannot be emphasized enough. We are often forced to choose between precision and accuracy during real-life sampling.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this chapter, we performed both tactile and virtual sampling exercises to infer about an unknown parameter We also presented a case study of sampling in real life with polls. In each case, we used the sample proportion <span class="math inline">\(\hat{p}\)</span> to estimate the population proportion <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. However, we are not just limited to scenarios related to proportions. In other words, we can use sampling to estimate other population parameters using other point estimates as well.</p>
<p>As we continue our journey, recall the case of Primrose Everdeen and what she represents: no matter how realistic is our model is, our predictions are <strong>never certain</strong>.</p>

Honestly the start of the chapter can be kind of confusing, and it would be less so if it was structured like the conclusion.  --><!-- RS: Overall, the start and the end of the chapter is good, but the middle has some confusing vocab mixups and it is not very helpful to teach someone how to actually approch the problem.
