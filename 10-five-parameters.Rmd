The next step in our model building education is to learn about *interactions*. The effect of a treatment relative to a control is almost never uniform. The effect might be bigger in women than in men, smaller in the rich relative to the poor. The technical term for such effects is "heterogenous," which is just Ph.D.'ese for "different." With enough data, all effects are heterogenous. Causal effects, at least in the social science, always vary across units. To model this reality, we rely on "interactions," on allowing for the effect size to differ. To so so, we need at least 5 parameters.

## EDA of `governors`

Packages:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(primer.data)
library(skimr)
library(tidyverse)
library(rstanarm)
```

<!-- Perhaps we need more detail in this EDA?  Explain how we only have data for people who are already dead. That is an interesting restriction, and effects the Preceptor Table in interesting ways. Or is such a discussion too advanced? -->

We will use the `governors` data set from the **primer.data** package. This data set, from @barfort2020, features the demographic information about the candidates for governor in the United States. @barfort2020 conclude that winning a gubernatorial election increases a candidate's lifespan.


```{r}
glimpse(governors)
```

<!-- DK: Should restrict the data to one observation per person. A subtle issue. Think about the infinite Preceptor Table. -->

There are `r ncol(governors)` variables and `r scales::comma(nrow(governors))` observations. In this Chapter, we will only be looking at the variables `last_name`, `year`, `state`, `sex`, `lived_after`, and `election_age`. 

```{r}
ch10 <- governors %>% 
  select(last_name, year, state, sex, lived_after, election_age)
```

`election_age` and `lived_after` are how many years a candidate lived before the election and how many years a candidate lived after the election, respectively. As a consequence, only politicians who are already deceased are included in this data set. This means that there are only a handful of observations from elections in the last 20 years. Most candidates from that time period are still alive and are, therefore, excluded.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Bit of a cheat to ensure that one of the sampled candidates is female.

set.seed(14)
```

```{r}
sample_n(ch10, 5)
```

`sex` is most often "Male", as we might expect.


```{r}
skim(ch10)
```

`skim()` groups the variables together by type.  We are given histograms of the numeric data. In looking at the histogram for `year`, we see that it is skewed right --- meaning that most of the data is bunched to the left and that there is a smaller tail to the right --- with half of the observations from election years between 1945 and 1962. This makes sense logically, because we are only looking at deceased candidates, and candidates from more recent elections are more likely to still be alive.

In using this data set, our left-side variable will be `lived_after`. We are trying to understand/predict how many years a candidate will live after the election. 


```{r}
ch10 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = lived_after)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "US Gubernatorial Candidate Years Lived Post-Election",
       subtitle = "Candidates who died more recently can't have lived for long post-election",
       caption = "Data: Barfort, Klemmensen and Larsen (2019)",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Years Lived After Election") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_number()) +
  theme_classic() 
```

<!-- DK: Fix -->

Starting with the relationship between `lived_after` and `year`, we can see that there is a rough line above which there are no observations. There are no data points in the top right portion of the graph because it is not possible to have run in 2011 and then live 50 years after the election took place. This edge of the data represents, approximately, the most years a candidate could have possibly lived, and still have died, given the year of the election. The reason the data is slanted downward is because the maximum value for this scenario is greater in earlier years. That is, those candidates who ran for governor in earlier years could live a long time after the election and still have died prior to the data set creation, giving them higher `lived_after` values than those who ran for office in more recent years. The edge of the scatter plot is not perfectly straight because, for many election years, no candidate had the decency to die just before data collection.

There are fewer observations in later years because fewer recent candidates have died recently. 


```{r}
ch10 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sex, y = lived_after)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "US Gubernatorial Candidate Years Lived Post-Election",
       subtitle = "Male candidates live much longer after the election",
       caption = "Data: Barfort, Klemmensen and Larsen (2019)",
       x = "Gender",
       y = "Years Lived After Election") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_number()) +
  theme_classic() 
```

This plot shows that men live much longer, on average, than women after the election. Does that make sense to you?



## Wisdom

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Wisdom"}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/Wisdom.jpg")
```

The concept of the "population" is subtle and important. *The population is not the set of candidates for which we have data.* That is the data set. The population is the larger --- potentially much larger --- set of individuals about whom we want to make inferences. *The parameters in our models refer to the population, not to the data set.*

Consider a simple example. Define $\mu$ as the average number of years lived by candidates for governor after Election Day. Can we calculate $\mu$ from our data? No! There are many candidates for governor who are still alive, who are not included in our data even though they are part of the "population" we want to study. $\mu$ can not be *calculated.* It can only be *estimated.*

Note, also, that there are many different populations, each with its own $\mu$, in which we might be interested. 

* The population of all candidates for governor in the US from 1945 to 2012. This is the period covered in the paper. 

* The population of all candidates for governor in the US from 1900 to 2012. A priori, we would not expect a major difference between candidates who run in 1946 and those who run in 1942. How different could they be? It is therefore not unreasonable to extend the population of interest back in time, even if we have no data for earlier periods.

* The population of all candidates for governor in the US from 1945 to 2030. We are often interested in the future. We want to make predictions about what will happen to candidates, even to candidates who have not yet run for office.

* The population of candidates for governor around the world. Other countries have governors also! We want to understand their longevity as well.

* The population of candidates for all political offices in the US. We might expect candidates for Senator to have similar lifespans to candidates for Governor.

* And so on. There are as many possible populations as there are questions we might ask.

All of these populations are different, so each has a different $\mu$. Which $\mu$ we are interested in depends on the problem we are trying to solve. It is a judgment call, a matter of Wisdom, as to whether or not that data we have is "close enough" to the population we are interested in to justify making a model.

## Justice and Courage

```

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="60%", fig.align='center', fig.cap = "Courage"}

```

Because we will be going through a series of models in this chapter, it is useful to combine the virtues of Justice and Courage. 


### election_age

To begin, let's model candidate lifespan after the election as a function of candidate lifespan prior to the election. The data:


```{r}
ch10 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = election_age, y = lived_after)) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(title = "Longevity of Gubernatorial Candidates",
         subtitle = "Younger candidates live longer", 
         caption = "Data Source: Barfort, Klemmensen and Larsen (2019)",
         x = "Age in Years on Election Day",
         y = "Years Lived After Election") +
    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::label_number()) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_number()) +
    theme_classic()
```


The math is fairly simple:

$$ lived\_after_i =  \beta_0 + \beta_1 election\_age_i + \epsilon_i $$


with $\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$. $lived\_after_i$ is the number of years lived after the election for candidate $i$. $election\_age_i$ is the number of years lived before the election for candidate $i$. $\epsilon_i$ is the "error term," the difference between the actual years-lived for candidate $i$ and the modeled years-lived.  $\epsilon_i$ is normally distributed with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of $\sigma$. The key distinction is between:

* *Variables*, always subscripted with $i$, whose values (potentially) vary across individuals.

* *Parameters*, never subscripted with $i$, whose values are constant across individuals.

<!-- DK: Better words needed. -->

$\beta_0$ is the "intercept" of the regression, the average value for the population of $alive\_post$, among those for whom $alive\_pre = 0$. $\beta_1$ is the "coefficient" of  $alive\_pre$. Each one day increase in $alive\_pre$ is associated with a $\beta_1$ change in $alive\_post$. Again, this is the value for the population from which our data is drawn.  


There are three unknown parameters --- $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$ and $\sigma$ --- just as with the models we used in Chapter \@ref(three-parameters).

You may recall from middle school algebra that the equation of a line is $y = m x + b$. There are two parameters: $m$ and $b$. The intercept $b$ is the value of $y$ when $x = 0$. The slope coefficient $m$ for $x$ is the increase in $y$ for every increase of one in $x$. When defining a regression line, we use slightly different notation but the fundamental relationship is the same. 

We can use `geom_smooth()` to create the fitted regression line:

```{r}
ch10 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = election_age, y = lived_after)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
    labs(title = "Longevity of Gubernatorial Candidates",
         subtitle = "Younger candidates live longer", 
         caption = "Data Source: Barfort, Klemmensen and Larsen (2019)",
         x = "Age in Years",
         y = "Years Lived After Election") +
    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::label_number()) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_number()) +
    theme_classic() 
```


Consider someone who is about 40 years old on Election Day. We have a score or more data points for candidates around that age. Two died soon after the election. Some of them lived for 50 or more years after the election. *Variation fills the world.* But the fitted line tells us that, on average, we would expect a candidate that age to live for a little less than 40 years after the election. 

<!-- DK: Add a red circle to the graphic to show how we figured that out? -->

This model, with a continuous independent (or "predictor") variable, has an infinite number of fitted values, one for each possible value of `election_age`. This is very different from the models we saw in Chapter \@ref(three-parameters). Those models only had two possible fitted values because the predictor variable only took two possible values.

<!-- DK: I am nervous that election_age, as used here, is a different variable that election_age when, later, we transform it.  -->

We can implement this model with `stan_glm()`. 


```{r}
fit_gov_1 <- stan_glm(data = ch10,
                      formula = lived_after ~ election_age,
                      refresh = 0,
                      seed = 9)
```

As we discussed in Chapter \@ref(three-parameters), the most common term for a model like this is a "regression." We have "regressed" `lived_after`, our dependent variable, on `election_age`, our (only) independent variable.

The parameter values:

```{r}
print(fit_gov_1, detail = FALSE)
```

As is almost always the case, $\sigma$ is a nuisance parameter, somethings whose value we are not interested in. This is why `stan_glm()` refers to it as an "Auxiliary" parameter.

The posterior distributions of $\beta_0$ (the intercept) and $\beta_1$ (the coefficient of $election\_age_i$), on the other hand, are important. Before looking at the posteriors themselves, let's examine the fitted values:

<!-- DK: Use this trick to create parallel and non-parallel line plots later. -->

```{r}
ch10 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = election_age, y = lived_after)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_line(aes(y = fitted(fit_gov_1)), color = "blue") +
    labs(title = "Longevity of Gubernatorial Candidates",
         subtitle = "Blue line shows fitted values", 
         caption = "Data Source: Barfort, Klemmensen and Larsen (2019)",
         x = "Age in Years",
         y = "Years Lived After Election") +
    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::label_number()) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_number()) +
    theme_classic()
```

This code is the same as the code we used above, except that we have replaced `geom_smooth()` with `geom_line()`. Calling `fitted()` on a model returns the set of fitted values, which we have here plotted by hand.


<!-- DK: Does this section work? If it does, we ought to do it in every chapter. If not, then why bother? It is certainly confusing to understand why sticking in the median is a good idea . . . Need to connected math to fitted values more clearly. But that might be difficult since I am hazy on how fitted values fit in a Bayesian context . . .-->

We can create a formula for the fitted values by placing the median values of the parameters into the model:

<!-- DK: This seems sloppy. equinomatic usage case?-->


$$ lived\_after_i =  26,500 - 0.9 election\_age_i$$

Consider the intercept. Since our independent variable is $election\_age_i$, the intercept is the $lived\_after_i$ value when $election\_age_i$ is zero. Here, we would interpret this intercept as the average lifespan of a gubernatorial candidate after the election, if the candidate was alive for zero years prior to the election. 

This is, of course, substantively nonsense. No one runs for office on the day they are born. In the next model, we will explore ways of making the intercept more interpretable. In the meantime, the math is the math. 

Consider the coefficient for $election\_age_i$, $\beta_1$. The median of the posterior, -0.9, represents the slope of the model. For every unit increase in our independent variable, our dependent variable will change by this amount. For every additional day a candidate is alive before an election, their lifespan after the election will be 0.9 years lower, on average. If we are given the number of years a candidate lived before the election and want to estimate how long they will live for after, we will multiply the years they were alive prior by this beta of -0.9, and then combine that with the intercept. 

This is a descriptive model, not a causal model. Remember our motto from Chapter \@ref(rubin-causal-model): *No causation without manipulation.* There is no way, for person $i$, to change the years that she has been alive on Election Day. On the day of this election, she is X years old. There is no way to change that. So, there are not two (or more) potential outcomes. Without more than one potential outcome, there can not be a causal effect.

Given that, it is important to monitor our language. We do not believe that that changes in `election_age` "cause" changes in `lived_after`. That is obvious. But there are some words and phrases --- like "associated with" and "change by" --- which are too close to causal. (And which we are guilty of using just a few paragraphs ago!) Be wary of their use. *Always think in terms of comparisons* when using a predictive model. We can't change `election_age` from X to Y for an individual candidate. We can only compare two candidates (or two groups of candidates), one with `election_age` equal to X and the other with `election_age` equal to Y. If our model is correct, such candidates will, on average, differ in `lived_after` by $\beta_1$ times the difference between X and Y.

<!-- DK: THis is a critical point. Maybe give a precise example? Go through the math slowly, like ModernDive does? Highlight this somehow? At the very least, we should emphasize the point for each model going forward. -->

Let's look at the posterior of $\beta_1$, the coefficient of $election\_age_i$:

<!-- DK: We should standardize what these plots look like, both in this chapter and throughout the book. -->

```{r}
fit_gov_1 %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(election_age)) + 
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),
                   bins = 100) +
    labs(title = "Posterior Distribution of the Coefficient of `election_age`",
         y = "Probability",
         x = "Coefficient of `election_age`") + 
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
    theme_classic()
```

<!-- DK: Add some interpretation. Need to explain how the uncertainty in beta_1 is connected to the uncertainty we will see in lived_after, for a given difference (not "change") in election_age. -->

<!-- DK: Priority is to add a graphic which shows the "cloud" of possible regression lines, consistent with the posterior for beta_1.  -->

<!-- DK: Need a smoother transition back to centering. Or get rid of centering all together? -->

<!-- DK: Would using 50-year-old be better? -->

<!-- DK: Fix. -->

We center variables when the model's intercept does not make substantive sense. To center a model, we pick a constant value, usually the mean of the independent variable, and subtract that constant from every value of the independent variable. Another option would be to pick a reasonable reference value, like 50 years-old. Either way, the meaning of `election_age` changes from the raw number of years a candidate has been alive to the number of years relative to that reference value. 

<!-- DK: Fix hard codes like 52 -->

In this example, we want to center the value for `election_age`, the independent variable. First, we must pick the value that we will center by. Here, we will use the mean of `election_age`, which is about `r round(mean(ch10$election_age), 0)` years old.  Once we find this number, we will subtract it from every `election_age` value, creating a new variable: `election_age_c`, where the "c" stand for **c**entered.  `election_age_c` is the number of years a candidate has been alive, as of Election Day, relative to the average years alive of all candidates on their respective election days.

```{r}
ch10 <- ch10 %>% 
  mutate(election_age_c = election_age - mean(election_age))
```



```{r, cache = TRUE}
fit_gov_1_centered <- stan_glm(data = ch10,
                      formula = lived_after ~ election_age_c,
                      refresh = 0,
                      seed = 11)

print(fit_gov_1_centered, detail = FALSE)
```

<!-- DK: If we are doing centering, then we ought to do it correctly, by showing side-by-side scatterplots with fitted lines, the better to show that we have just slid things over. -->


We can see that the intercept has decreased while the slope has stayed the same. When we interpret this model, we only have to change the definition of the intercept. Rather than the intercept representing the remaining years of a candidate who was alive for zero years before running for governor, it now represents the post-election lifespan of a gubernatorial candidate who was alive for the mean number of years before running. If a candidate was alive for about `r round(mean(ch10$election_age), 0)` years before running for governor, they are expected to live for about `r round(coef(fit_gov_1_centered)["(Intercept)"], 0)` years after the election, on average. 

<!-- DK: Really need the ideal and actual Preceptor Table for this example. And should probably present it earlier. -->

Think hard about your parameters. What do they mean? Which population do they represent? What ideal Preceptor Table would make their calculation easy? In this case, $\beta_0$ is the average number of years which gubernatorial candidates live after election day, but just for the subset of candidates who are the average age on Election Day. If we had the ideal Preceptor Table, this would be trivial to calculate. Just take the average for that subset! No estimation required. But, our actual Preceptor Table has lots of missing values. In particular, many gubernatorial candidates have not . . . uh . . . died. (How inconsiderate!) So, we can't know how many years they will live. All we can do is, first, define  $\beta_0$ and, second, estimate a posterior probability distribution for it. 

### sex

Let's now regress `lived_after` on `sex` to see how candidates' post-election lifespans differ by sex. 

```{r, cache = TRUE}
fit_gov_2 <- stan_glm(data = ch10,
                      formula = lived_after ~ sex - 1,
                      refresh = 0,
                      seed = 16)
```

Note this workflow. Try one model. Interpret it. Try another model. And then another. There is no one "true" model. There is an infinite space of possible models. Good data science involves an intelligent tour of that space.


```{r}
print(fit_gov_2, detail = FALSE)
```


In this regression, we use the -1 in the formula to make the output more straightforward, with no intercept to interpret. The math of this model is the same as those we saw in Chapter \@ref(three-parameters):

$$ lived\_after_i = \beta_1 x_{f,i} + \beta_2 x_{m,i} + \epsilon_i$$

where \n
$$x_{f,i}, x_{m,i} \in \{0,1\}$$ \n
$$x_{f,i} +  x_{m,i} = 1$$ \n
$$\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$$  

<!-- DK: Provide more details on what each of the items in the formula means, even though this is a repeat of what we did in chapter 8. Don't use "where" with line skips. Just one paragrpah, like elsewhere. -->

The meanings of $lived\_after_i$ and $\epsilon_i$ are the same as in the first model. Indeed, they are the same throughout these exercises.  $x_{f,i}$ and $x_{m,i}$ are 0/1 variables, just like last chapter. They are *variables* whose values vary across individuals.

The important parameters are $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$. They are the average years-lived post-election for, respectively, women and men. Again, this is not the "average" for the data we have. That is easy to calculate! No estimation required. $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are averages for the entire "population," however we have chosen to define that term. Those averages can not be calculated directly. They can only be estimated, by creating a posterior probability distribution.

<!-- DK: Fix -->

Looking back to the regression model we just created, we see that there is no intercept. Instead of having a $\beta_0$ value, we have $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ for female and male. This makes things easier to interpret. Without having to add or subtract anything from an intercept, this regression tells us that, on average, women are expected to live about `r round(coef(fit_gov_2)["sexFemale"], 0)` years after running for governor, and men are expected to live about `r `round(coef(fit_gov_2)["sexMale"], 0)` years.

This is a strange result. Why would men live almost twice as long as women after the election? One explanation for this might be that women don't run for governor until later in life, and therefore are not expected to live as long.

<!-- DK: Weird result, huh? Men live twice as long as women! Useful to discuss why that might be the case in more detail. -->

Now that we have interpreted the model using a -1 in the formula to estimate $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$, let's take away the -1 and regress `lived_after` on an intercept and  `sex` to see how our equation changes.


```{r}
fit_gov_2a <- stan_glm(data = ch10,
                       formula = lived_after ~ sex,
                       refresh = 0,
                       seed = 76)
```

```{r}
print(fit_gov_2a, detail = FALSE)
```

We no longer have a value for female. However we do have an intercept. In this regression our mathematical formula is:

$$ lived\_after_i = \beta_0  + \beta_1 x_{m,i} + \epsilon_i$$

$\beta_0$ is our intercept, around `r round(coef(fit_gov_2a)["(Intercept)"], 0)` years. This result is very similar to the female value from before. In this type of model, our intercept represents the the variable which is not represented in the model.  $\beta_1$ only affects the outcome when the candidate is male. (If the candidate is female, then $x_{m,i} = 0$. Therefore, the intercept value represents those who are not male, i.e., females.)

<!-- DK: This explanation should be better. -->

When the candidate is a male, we add the coefficient for male to the intercept value, which gives us the average lifespan of a male gubernatorial candidate after an election. As we can see from adding $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$, this value is the same as what we got for males in the previous model.

Be careful with notation! $\beta_1$ in the no-intercept model is different from $\beta_1$  in the model with an intercept! Notation varies. We must pay attention each time we make a model.


The posterior distribution for $\beta_0 + \beta_1$ can be constructed via simple addition.


```{r}
fit_gov_2a %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(male_intercept = `(Intercept)` + sexMale) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(male_intercept)) + 
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),
                   bins = 100) +
    labs(title = "Posterior Distribution of Average Male Candidate Years Left`",
         y = "Probability",
         x = "Male Years To Live After the Election") + 
    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::number_format()) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
    theme_classic()
```


<!-- DK: Fix -->

The interpretation of this parameter is the same as we have seen before. There is a true average, across the entire population, of the number of years that male candidates live after the election. We can never know what that true average is. But, it seems very likely that the true average is somewhere between 27.5 and 29.5 years.


### election_age_c and sex


We are going to transition to working with a model that has more than one explanatory variable. Our outcome variable will be `lived_after`, but now we will have two different explanatory variables: `election_age_c` and `sex`. Note that `sex` is a categorical explanatory variable and `election_age_c` is a continuous explanatory variable.



Here is the math we will be using: 

$$ lived\_after_i =  \beta_0 + \beta_1 male_i + \beta_2 election\_age\_c_i + \epsilon_i $$

* The outcome variable is $lived\_after_i$, the number of years a person is alive after the election. $male_i$ is one of our explanatory variables. If we are predicting the number of years a male candidate lives after the election, this value will be 1. When we are making this prediction for female candidates, this value will be 0. $election\_age\_c_i$ is our other explanatory variable. It is the number of years a candidate has lived before the election. 


* $\beta_0$ is the average number of years lived after the election for women, who on the day of election, have been alive the average number of years of all candidates (i.e. both male and female). $\beta_0$ is also the intercept of the equation. In other words, $\beta_0$ is the expected value of $lived\_after_i$, if $male_i = 0$ and $election\_age\_c_i = 0$. 

* $\beta_1$ is almost meaningless by itself. The only time it has meaning is when its value is connected to our intercept (i.e. $\beta_0 + \beta_1$). When the two are added together, you get the average number of years lived after the election for men, who on the day of election, have been alive the average number of years for all candidates.

* $\beta_2$ is, for the entire population, the average difference in $lived\_after_i$ between two individuals, one of whom has an $election\_age\_c_i$ value of 1 greater than the other. 



Now that we understand our model, let's translate the following model into code. 

```{r, cache = TRUE}
fit_gov_3 <- stan_glm(data = ch10,
                      formula = lived_after ~ sex + election_age_c,
                      refresh = 0,
                      seed = 12)
```

```{r}
print(fit_gov_3, detail = FALSE)
```




Looking at our results, you can see that our intercept value is around `r round(coef(fit_gov_3)["(Intercept)"], 0)`. (The exact values for the median of the posterior will vary because of the random sampling inherent in fitting the model.) This means that the average female candidate, who had been alive the average number of years of all candidates, would live another `r round(coef(fit_gov_3)["(Intercept)"], 0)` years or so after the election. 


Note that `sexMale` is around `r round(coef(fit_gov_3)["sexMale"], 0)`. This is our coefficient, $\beta_1$. We need to connect this value to our intercept value to get something meaningful. Using the formula $\beta_0 + \beta_1$, we find out that the number of years the average male candidate ---  who, on the day of election, is the average age of all candidates --- would live is around `r round(coef(fit_gov_3)["(Intercept)"] + coef(fit_gov_3)["sexMale"], 0)` years.  


Now take a look at the coefficient for $election\_age\_c_i$, $\beta_2$. The median of the posterior, `r round(coef(fit_gov_3)["election_age_c"], 1)`, represents the slope of the model. When comparing two candates who differ by one year in `election_age_c`, we expect that they will differ by `r round(coef(fit_gov_3)["election_age_c"], 1)` years in `lived_after`. It makes sense that this value is negative. Think about it: the more years a candidate has lived, the fewer years the candidate has left to live. So, for every extra year a candidate is alive before an election, their lifespan after the election will be `r abs(round(coef(fit_gov_3)["election_age_c"], 1))` years lower, on average.


Let’s now look at some posteriors.

```{r}
fit_gov_3 %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(male_years = `(Intercept)` + sexMale) %>% 
  rename(female_years = `(Intercept)`) %>% 
  select(female_years, male_years) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = female_years:male_years, 
               names_to = "parameters",
               values_to = "years") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(years, fill = parameters)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),
                   alpha = 0.5, 
                   bins = 100, 
                   position = "identity") +
     labs(title = "Posterior Probability Distribution",
         subtitle = "Men live longer",
         x = "Average Years Lived Post Election",
         y = "Probability") + 
    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(accuracy = 1)) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
    theme_classic()
```

<!-- DK: Much more to say here, and say it clearly! -->

The graph above displays the posterior probability distributions for $\beta_0$ and for $\beta_0 + \beta_1 $. The two distributions are fairly different; the distribution for females is more spread out than that for males. There were a greater number of men than women in the data. The more data we have, the more precise we can be.


Let's now take a look at a posterior distribution for $\beta_2$, the coefficient of $election\_age\_c_i$. 

```{r fit_gov3-p1, exercise = TRUE}
fit_gov_3 %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(election_age_c)) + 
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),
                   bins = 100) +
    labs(title = "Posterior Distribution of the Coefficient of `election_age_c`",
         y = "Probability",
         x = "Coefficient of `election_age_c`") + 
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
    theme_classic()

```

<!-- DK: Show three posterior plots: one for beta_2, one for beta_0 (intercept) and one for beta_0 + beta_1.  Interpret them. This is a parallel slopes model. Can we show a parallel slopes graph by hand? Skip this for now. -->


<!-- DK: Cool, eh? It is (mostly?) an age effect! Controlling for age at the election, women live about as long as men, but they are much more likely be candidates as an older age. Again, what we are doing is slowly building more complex models, understanding what they mean. -->

<!-- Also, note that this is a "parallel slopes" model. Explain slowly what that means.  Create a plot. -->

<!-- Side note: I would have thought that overlapping CIs for male/female would equate to insignificance of sex dummy when the regression includes a intercept. But that does not seem to be the case. Am I missing something? -->

<!-- With this as warm-up, we are now in a position to explore interactions. -->

### election_age_c, sex and election_age_c*sex

Let's create another model. This time, however, the numeric outcome variable of lived_after as a function of the two explanatory variables we used above, `election_age_c` and `sex`, and of their interaction.

Math:

$$ lived\_after_i =  \beta_0 + \beta_1 male_i + \beta_2 election\_age\_c_i + \\ \beta_3 male_i *  election\_age\_c_i + \epsilon_i$$
<!-- DK: Need to make these interpretations clearer and more consistent across the examples. -->

* Our outcome variable is still $lived\_after_i$. We want to know how many years a candidate will live after an election. 

* $male_i$ is still one of our explanatory variables. If we are predicting the amount of years a male candidate lives after the election, this will be 1. When we are making this prediction for female candidate, this will be 0. $election\_age\_c_i$ is still our other explanatory variable, representing the number of years a candidate has lived before the election, relative to the average value for all candidates. 

* $\beta_0$ is the average number of years lived after the election for women, who on the day of election, have been alive the average number of years of all candidates. In a sense, this is the same meaning as in the previous model, without an interaction term. But, always remember that the meaning of a parameter is conditional on the model in which it is embedded. Even if a parameter is called $\beta_0$ in two different regressions does necessitate that it means the same thing in both regressions. Parameter names are arbitrary, or at least simply a matter of convention.

* $\beta_1$ does not have a simple interpretation as a stand-alone parameter. It is a measure of how different women are from men. However, $\beta_0 + \beta_1$ has a straightforward meaning exactly analogous to the meaning of $\beta_0$. The sum  is the average number of years lived after the election for *men*, who on the day of election, have been alive the average number of years of all candidates.

* $\beta_2$ is the coefficient of $election\_age\_c_i$. It it just the slope for women. It is the average difference in $lived\_after_i$ between two women, one of whom has an $election\_age\_c_i$ value of 1 greater than the other. In our last example,  $\beta_2$ was the slope for the whole population. Now we are different slopes for different genders. 

* $\beta_3$ alone is difficult to interpret. However, when it is added to $\beta_2$, the result in the slope for men.

Code:

```{r, cache = TRUE}
fit_gov_4 <- stan_glm(data = ch10,
                      formula = lived_after ~ sex*election_age_c,
                      refresh = 0,
                      seed = 13)
```

```{r}
print(fit_gov_4, detail = FALSE)
```

<!-- DK: Take your time explaining what this means! It is not trivial. Note that this is a non-parallel slopes model. -->

<!-- DK: Fix -->

The intercept has increased. $\beta_0$ is around `r round(coef(fit_gov_4)["(Intercept)"], 0)`. This is the intercept for females. It still means the average number of years lived after the election for women is `r round(coef(fit_gov_4)["(Intercept)"], 0)` or so. Our `sexMale` coefficient, $\beta_1$, refers to the value that must be added to the intercept in order to get the average for males. When calculated, the result is `r round(coef(fit_gov_4)["(Intercept)"] + coef(fit_gov_4)["sexMale"], 0)`. Keep in mind, however, that these values only apply if $election\_age\_c_i = 0$, if, that is, candidate $i$ is around 52 years old. 

The coefficient for $election\_age\_c_i$, $\beta_2$, is `r round(coef(fit_gov_4)["election_age_c"], 1)`. What does this mean? It is the slope for females. So, when comparing two female candidates who differ by one year in age, we expect that the older candidate will live `r abs(round(coef(fit_gov_4)["election_age_c"], 1))` years less. Now direct your attention below at the coefficient of `sexMale:election_age_c`, $\beta_3$, which is `r round(coef(fit_gov_4)["sexMale:election_age_c"], 1)`. This is the value that must be added to the coefficient of $election\_age\_c_i$ (recall $\beta_2 + \beta_3$) in order to find the slope for males. When the two are added together, this value, or slope, is about `r round(coef(fit_gov_4)["election_age_c"] + coef(fit_gov_4)["sexMale:election_age_c"], 1)`. When comparing two male candidates who differ in age by one year, we expect the older candidate to live about `r abs(round(coef(fit_gov_4)["election_age_c"] + coef(fit_gov_4)["sexMale:election_age_c"], 1))` years less. 

*Key point*: The interpretation of the intercepts only apply to candidates for whom $election\_age\_c_i = 0$. Candidates who are not 52 years-old will have different expected number of years to live. The interpretation of the slope applies to everyone. In other words, the relationship between $lived\_after_i$ and $election\_age\_c_i$ is the same, regardless of your gender or how old you are.


The posterior:


```{r}
fit_gov_4 %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(male_years = `(Intercept)` + sexMale) %>% 
  rename(female_years = `(Intercept)`) %>% 
  select(female_years, male_years) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = female_years:male_years, 
               names_to = "parameters",
               values_to = "years") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(years, fill = parameters)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),
                   alpha = 0.5, 
                   bins = 100, 
                   position = "identity") +
    labs(title = "Posterior Probability Distribution",
         subtitle = "Men live longer",
         x = "Average Years Lived Post Election",
         y = "Probability") + 
    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::number_format()) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
    theme_classic()
```


Male candidates live longer on average than female candidates. Note, also, that the average years to live after the election for females is about `r round(coef(fit_gov_4)["(Intercept)"], 0)` with this model. With the previous model, it was `r round(coef(fit_gov_3)["(Intercept)"], 0)` years. Why the difference? The interpretation of "average" is different! In the previous model, it was the average for all women. In this model, it is the average for all 52 years-old women. Those are different things, so we should hardly be surprised by different posteriors.

<!-- DK: Is the above right? -->
 

Slope posteriors:

```{r}
fit_gov_4 %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(slope_men = election_age_c + `sexMale:election_age_c`) %>% 
  rename(slope_women = election_age_c) %>% 
  select(slope_women, slope_men) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = slope_women:slope_men, 
               names_to = "parameters",
               values_to = "slope") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(slope, fill = parameters)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),
                   alpha = 0.5, 
                   bins = 100, 
                   position = "identity") +
    labs(title = "Posterior Probability Distribution",
         subtitle = "Men have a steeper slope",
         x = "slope",
         y = "Probability") + 
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
    theme_classic() 
```

This posterior distribution shows the average slope values for men and women. You can see that men have a steeper slope, while the slope for women is practically 0! *If you are trying to forecast the number of years that a women will live after the election, you may ignore the number of years that she has already lived.* This is definitely not true for men. Why the difference?
 
<!-- DK: Answer this question!  -->

### What is $\beta_0$?

Attentive readers will have noticed that the meaning of $\beta_0$ is identical for the last two models and, at the same time, our estimate for its posterior are very different. How can that be?

Recall the math:

$$ lived\_after_i =  \beta_0 + \beta_1 male_i + \beta_2 election\_age\_c_i + \epsilon_i $$

$$ lived\_after_i =  \beta_0 + \beta_1 male_i + \beta_2 election\_age\_c_i + \\ \beta_3 male_i *  election\_age\_c_i + \epsilon_i$$
In both cases, $\beta_0$ has the same meaning. It is the average number of years lived after the election for women, who on the day of election, have been alive the average number of years of all candidates. Plug in 0 for $male_i$ and 0 for $election\_age\_c_i$ and both equations simplify to:

$$ lived\_after_i =  \beta_0 + \epsilon_i $$
So far, so good. But, despite the fact that we are using the same data, the posterior probability distributions for $\beta_0$ are meaningfully different between the two models:

```{r}
m_3 <- fit_gov_3 %>% 
  as_tibble() %>%
  select(`(Intercept)`) %>% 
  rename(`No Interaction Term` = `(Intercept)`)

m_4 <- fit_gov_4 %>% 
  as_tibble() %>%
  select(`(Intercept)`) %>% 
  rename(`With Interaction Term` = `(Intercept)`)

bind_cols(m_3, m_4) %>% 
  select(`No Interaction Term`, `With Interaction Term`) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = `No Interaction Term`:`With Interaction Term`, 
               names_to = "Model",
               values_to = "years") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(years, fill = Model)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),
                   alpha = 0.5, 
                   bins = 100, 
                   position = "identity") +
    labs(title = "Posterior Probability Distributions",
         subtitle = "For intercept in two different models",
         x = "Additional Years Lived Post Election",
         y = "Probability") + 
    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::number_format()) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
    theme_classic()
```

There is enough overlap between the two distributions that they aren't completely incompatible. If, in truth, $\beta_0 = 20$, neither posterior distribution is "wrong."

The meaning of any parameter, including $\beta_0$, is conditional on two assumptions: the population for which we seek to make inferences and the structure of the model. In this case, we assume that the population of interest is the same. But the models are different, albeit only by one interaction term. But that is enough of a difference to make $\beta_0$ in the first model a different "thing" that $\beta_0$ in the second model, even if one "interpretation" of what they mean is the same.

The trick is that an individual interpretation of the meaning of a parameter just captures one characteristic of the meaning of that parameter. It is just a single view of the "thing." That view is fine, as far as it goes, but it can't show us all aspects of the parameter. A picture of the full moon tells us little about what appears on its dark side.

Consider a different question: What is the expected value for male candidates who are 1 year older than average:

* Without an interaction term: $\beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_2 1$.

* With an interaction term: $\beta_0 + \beta_1 + \beta_2 1 + \beta_3 1$. 

We shouldn't be surprised that different models generate different formulas for this question. Yet note how $\beta_0$ appears in both. In other words, $\beta_0$ is not *only* the average number of years lived after the election for women, who on the day of election, have been alive the average number of years of all candidates. It is also part of a multitude of other estimates. 

*The only way to understand all of what is wrapped up in $\beta_0$ is to see it in the context of the full mathematical formula.* Since we have two different models, defined by two different formulas, it is hardly surprising that the posterior probability distributions for $beta_0$ will differ, even though one specific interpretation --- one out of many --- is the same.

Our advice: Spend less time thinking about what parameters *mean* and more time using `posterior_epred()` and `posterior_predict()` to examine the implications of your models. Those posteriors are the real substance of your model.




## Temperance

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Temperance"}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/Temperance.jpg")
```

Consider:

* How long will two political candidates --- one male and one female, both 10 years older than the average candidate --- live after the election? How different will their lifespans be?

These questions are, purposely, less precise than the ones we tackled in Chapters \@ref(two-parameters) and \@ref(three-parameters), written more in a conversational style. This is how normal people talk.

However, as data scientists, our job is to bring precision to these questions. There are two commonsense interpretations. First, we could be curious about the *expected values* for these questions. If we averaged the data for a thousand candidates like these, what would the answer be? Second, we could be curious about two specific individuals. How long will they live? *Averages involve questions about parameters. The fates of individuals require predictions.* Those are general claims, violated too often to be firm rules. Yet, they highlight a key point: *expected values are less variable than individual predictions*.

To calculate expected values, use `posterior_epred()`. To forecast for individuals, use `posterior_predict()`.

### Expected values

Consider the "on average" interpretation first. The answer begins with the posterior distributions of the parameters in `fit_gov_4`.

<!-- DK: We need to walk through the math. Start with the original formula. Replace the x's with the values for this person. Simplify. Plug in the parameters, which are distributions. This gives us the answer. It goes too fast to just go straight for the code. -->

newobs = tibble(sex = c("Male", "Female"), 
                 election_age_c = 10)

pe <- posterior_epred(object = fit_gov_4, 
                      newdata = newobs) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  rename("Male" = `1`,
         "Female" = `2`)

 pivot_longer(cols = Male:Female, 
               names_to = "Gender",
               values_to = "years") %>%

```

<!-- DK: Do males live longer than females, even when both of 62? That is surprising! -->

<!-- DK: Need to discuss if we would get the same answer for candidates of ages other than 62. Not sure myself! -->

Looking at our posterior probability distributions above, we can see that male candidates are expected to live longer. But how much longer? As in previous chapters, we can manipulate distributions in, more or less, the same way that we manipulate simple numbers. If we want to know the difference between two posterior distributions, we can simply subtract. 


```{r}
pe <- posterior_epred(object = fit_gov_4, 
                      newdata = newobs) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(diff = `1` - `2`)


pe %>% 
  ggplot(aes(diff)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),
                   alpha = 0.5, 
                   bins = 100, 
                   position = "identity") +
    labs(title = "Posterior Probability Distribution",
         subtitle = "Male candidates live longer",
         x = "Expected Additional Years Lived Post Election",
         y = "Probability") + 
    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(accuracy = 1)) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
    theme_classic()
```



The average value of the difference in years-to-live is probably positive, with the most likely value being around `r round(mean(pe$diff), 0)` years. But there still a `r round(sum(pe$diff < 0) / length(pe$diff), 2) * 100`% chance the true value is less than zero, i.e., that we should expect female candidates to live longer.


Instead of using `posterior_epred()`, we could have answered these questions by using the posterior probability distributions for the parameters in the model, along with some simple math. Don't do this! First, you are much more likely to make a mistake. Second, this approach does not generalize well to complex models with scores of parameters and their interactions.



### Individual predictions

If, instead, we interpret the question as asking for a prediction for a small number of individuals, then we need to use `posterior_predict()`.


<!-- DK: Try again to explain what a posterior prediction is. -->

Use `posterior_predict()` to create draws from the posterior probability distribution for our prediction for these cases. `posterior_predict()` takes two arguments: the model for which the simulations should be run, and a tibble indicating the covariate values for the individual(s) we want to predict. In this case, we are using the `fit_gov_4` model and the tibble is the one we just created above. In other words, the inputs for `posterior_predict()` and `posterior_epred()` are identical. 

```{r}
pp <- posterior_predict(object = fit_gov_4, 
                        newdata = newobs) %>%
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate_all(as.numeric) %>% 
  rename("Male" = `1`,
         "Female" = `2`)

pp  
```

The resulting tibble has 2 columns, the first for a male candidate and the second for female candidate. Both columns are draws from the posterior predictive distributions. In both cases, the forecasts depend on the values of all the covariates. That is, we would provide a different forecast if the candidates were younger or older. 

<!-- DK: Already explained mutate_all(as.numeric) in previous chapters. -->

Why do we need the weird `mutate_all(as.numeric)` incantation? The reason is that `posterior_epred()` returns a simple matrix, which is easy to transform into a tibble. `posterior_predict()`, on the other hand, returns a special sort of matrix which is much harder to work with. So, we need a little hackery to make the next steps easier.

Let's look at the posterior predictive distribution for each candidate.


```{r}
pp %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = Male:Female, 
               names_to = "Gender",
               values_to = "years") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(years, fill = Gender)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),
                   alpha = 0.5, 
                   bins = 100, 
                   position = "identity") +
    labs(title = "Posterior Predictive Distribution",
         subtitle = "For a male and female candidate",
         x = "Years Lived Post Election",
         y = "Probability") + 
    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::number_format()) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = 
                         scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
    theme_classic()
```



There is a big overlap in the predictions for individuals while, at the same time, there is much less overlap in the averages. Random stuff happens to an individual all the time. Random stuff cancels out when you take the average for many individuals. Consider the difference in the posterior predictive distributions for the two individuals.

<!-- DK: Example "Posterior Predictive Distribution" -->

```{r}
pp %>% 
  mutate(diff = Male - Female) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(diff)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),
                   alpha = 0.5, 
                   bins = 100,

<!-- DK: Fix. Could not figure out how to calculate the 13 years on the fly. Code like this `r round(mean(pp[,2] - pp[,1]), 0)` did not work. Problem is that the pp tibble has variable names 1 and 2, but we can't grab those with pp$`1` because that expression is within the backticks of an inline R code chunk. -->

In words, we would predict that the male candidate would live longer than the female candidate. By how much? Well, that number is an unknown parameter. By looking at our posterior above, our best estimate is about `r round(pp %>% mutate(diff = Male - Female) %>% pull(diff) %>% mean(), 1)` years. However, it is quite possible that, for any given male/female candidates, the female will live longer.


```{r}
pp %>% 
  mutate(diff = Male - Female) %>% 
  summarize(f_live_longer = sum(diff < 0),
            total = n(),
            f_live_longer / total)
```
In fact, there is a 4 in 10 chance that the female candidate lives longer.


*Note what is the same and what is different when we move from a question about averages to a question about individuals.* In both cases, the most likely value is about the same. That is, the average behavior is the same as our expected value for any given individual. But the uncertainty is much greater for an individual prediction. The chance of the true average for male candidates being less than that for female candidates is low. Yet, for any individual pair of candidates, it would not even be slightly surprising for the female candidate to outlive the male candidate. Individuals vary. Averages never tell the whole story.

### Expectation versus individual variation

Let's compare the results from `posterior_epred()` and `posterior_predict()` for this scenario directly. Most of this code is the same as what we have shown you above, but we think it is useful to look at everything together.


```{r}
newobs <- tibble(sex = c("Male", "Female"),
                  election_age_c = 10)

pe <- posterior_epred(fit_gov_4, 
                      newdata = newobs) %>%
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(diff = `1` - `2`)

pp <- posterior_predict(fit_gov_4, 
                        newdata = newobs) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate_all(as.numeric) %>% 
  mutate(diff = `1` - `2`)

tibble(Expectation = pe$diff,
       Prediction = pp$diff) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = Expectation:Prediction, 
               names_to = "Type",
               values_to = "years") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(years, fill = Type)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),
                   alpha = 0.5, 
                   bins = 100, 
                   position = "identity") +
    labs(title = "Posterior Probability Distributions",
         subtitle = "For 62 years-old male and female candidates",
         x = "Additional Years Lived Post Election",
         y = "Probability") + 
    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::number_format()) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = 
                         scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
    theme_classic()
```

Expected values vary much less than predictions. The above chart makes that easy to see. We are somewhat sure that the true underlying average for the numbers of years that male candidates live post-election is more than female candidates. But, for any two individual candidates, there is a good chance that that the female candidate will live longer. We can not ignore $\epsilon$ when predicting the outcome for individuals. When estimating expected values or long-run averages, the  $\epsilon$'s cancel out. 

<!-- DK: Discuss the substantive issue? How can it be that Washington candidates live longer? Also, compare these estimates to what naive lm() would tell us. -->

### Testing

In a normal statistics book, we would have already discussed the concept of "testing" extensively. The terminology varies by field. "Tests," "testing," "hypothesis tests," "tests of significance," and "null hypothesis significance testing" all refer to the same concept. We will refer to this collection of approaches as NHST, a common abbreviation derived from the initials of the last phrase. Wikpedia provides an [overview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing). 

*Our view: Amateurs test. Professionals summarize.*

Consider the question of the expected difference in lifespans for our South Dakato and Washington candidates. Is that difference "significant?" Can we "reject the null hypothesis?" The convential answer is Yes. Anytime that zero is outside of the 95% confidence interval, we can declare the result significant. But why should we? What does that gain us? We already have the full posterior probability distribution. That is knowledge. A Yes/No question throws away too much information to (almost) ever be useful. There is no reason to *test* when you can *summarize* by providing the full posterior probability distribution.

The same arguments apply in the case of "insignificant" results, with "$p > 0.5$, when we can't "reject" the null hypothesis. Instead of expected values, consider the case of two candidates, one from South Dakota and one from Washington. Is the difference in their predicted lifespans "significant?" Who cares!? We have the full posterior probability distribution for that prediction --- also known as the posterior predictive distribution --- as graphed above. The 95% confidence interval includes zero. Does that mean we should throw it away? No! That would be nonsense. Yes, there is a 20% chance that the South Dakota candidate lives longer, so we can hardly be surprised when that happens. But we still think that it is much more likely that the Washington candidate lives longer. Indeed, we would consider 4-to-1 odds as fair. The fact that the difference is not "significant" has no relevance to how we use the posterior to make decisions.

The same reasoning applies to every parameter we estimate, to every prediction we make. Never test --- unless your boss demands a test. *Use your judgment, make your models, summarize your knowledge of the world, and use that summary to make decisions.*
