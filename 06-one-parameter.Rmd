<!-- RS: Agree with all edits (I kind of got caried away sometimes, especially with explaining posteiror_erpred()) but there are 3 exceptions: First minor change, I added back elipses at bottom of the Preceptor Tables, because I am trying to make it uniform across the chapter that there is alot we don't know about the urn because we can never access it physically. Another minor change is that I think the Now + 10 stuff is kind of confusing, so I did not write it just yet. Finally,  a more major change is I kept my Bayesian framework section! When reading Ch.6 and 7 I wish I had something similar to what I wrote, so I protest deleting it! -->

<!-- 6.3 Sample size (What happens when we change sample size?) -->

<!-- Questions: I feel like we need more explanation about confidence intervals. Also do we want to differentiate between calculating an unknown population proportion and an unknown mu? Nonetheless I feel like understanding that if we take a simple random sample, how to construct a 95% confidence interval using $\bar{x}$ +/- 2(SD), because I feel like it is not emphasized how cool it is how our samples will be normally distributed no matter if if our population is normally distributed, but this could be too much statistics. 

<!-- 1. Comparing sampling distributions:  -->

<!--  - a. What is a sampling distribution? Introduce some vocab, but cut out unessential stuff (vocab is boring). Emphasize that this is a model, and we will never have the sampling distribution in real life. Also create vocab distinctions. Although the actual sampling distribution consists of many more trials, 1,000 is large enough for our purposes, and as such we will refer to distributions with many trials as sampling distributions.  -->

<!--  - b. Re-factoring our code: Start with a question: How do the sampling distributions of shovel sizes 25, 50, and 100 compare. Then make 3 separate variables. Yuck! Re-factor our code to make one tibble, using both mapping and expand_grid().  -->

<!--  - c. Variance: Make 3 graphs to explain variance.  -->

<!--  - End section with finding standard deviation of each sampling distribution. Foreshadow that this is related to the Standard Error.   -->

<!--  - In this section readers will make the facet wrapped graph, the colored graph of 1,000 p values for each shovel size, and the line graph that plots standard deviation against shovel size.  -->

<!-- 2. Standard deviation and standard error:  -->

<!--  - a. Standard Deviation: We just took the standard deviation of sampling distributions for different shovel sizes. What are the implications? Use graphs of the 3 different sampling distributions but add sd and mean lines. Explain that the mean is the same as the population proportion. When we have a larger sample size, our samples are more likely to be close to the real population proportion.  -->

<!--  - b. Standard Error: Standard deviation of a point statistic. Before we were looking at our entire population. Now we look at a single sample, and ask ourselves how close/how far is this from the real population parameter. This is standard error, and it is related to standard deviation: When the standard deviation of our sampling distribution is low, each sample more likely to be closer to the real pop parameter, and as such each individual sample is more likely to have a smaller standard error.  -->

<!-- 3. SE and SD equations:  -->

<!--   - a. Vocab: Reuse stuff from current section, maybe cut back a little.  -->

<!--   - b. Standard deviation for a population proportion: Show the equation (sqrt(p(1-p)/n)) for calculating standard deviation. Overlay sd equation on the graph of 100 sample sizes as well as the facet wrapped graph to show that they produce the same result.  Make sure to use mean of sampling distribution for our estimate of p.-->

Introduce the vocab and write up in the primer, and then dive into the dataset in the tutorials. Data set has collumn for "are you married" which allows us to estimate a population proportion, but it also has other data that can allow us to calculate the population mu within a certain confidence interval if we know sigma, but this might be too much. However, I do think it is important to differentiate finding a population mu vs population proportion. Also should I incorporate this into the existing tutorial or make a new tutorial? -->

*This chapter is being re-drafted.*

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_app("https://www.youtube.com/embed/e3PJ3Du_zDc")
```

*The Hunger Games* is a dystopian novel in which children are chosen via lottery to fight to the death. Primrose Everdeen is selected from the urn. Why does she have the misfortune of being selected? Or, as we data scientists say, *sampled*?

In Chapter \@ref(probability), we learned about probability, the framework for quantifying uncertainty. In this chapter, we will learn about *sampling*, the beginning of our journey toward inference. When we sample, we take some *units* from a *population*, calculate statistics based on those units, and make inferences about unknown *parameters* associated with the population. 

The urn below has a certain number of red and a certain number of white beads all of equal size, mixed well together. What proportion, $\rho$, of this urn's beads are red? 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "An urn with red and white beads."}
knitr::include_graphics("06-one-parameter/images/sampling_bowl_1.jpg")
```

One way to answer this question would be to perform an exhaustive count: remove each bead individually, count the number of red beads, count the number of white beads, and divide the number of red beads by the total number of beads. Call that ratio $\rho$, the proportion of red beads in the urn. However, this would be a long and tedious process. Therefore, we will use sampling! Consider two questions:

*If we get 17 red beads in a random sample of size 50 taken from a mixed urn, what proportion $\rho$ of the beads in the urn are red?*

*What is the probability, using that same urn, that we will draw more than 8 red beads if we use a shovel of size 20?*

To begin this chapter, we will look at a real sampling activity: the urn.  Then, we will simulate the urn example using R code. This will help us to understand the *standard error* and the ways in which uncertainty factors into our predictions. We then attempt to estimate a single parameter, the proportion of red beads in the urn. 

Use the **tidyverse** package.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Real sampling activity {#sampling-activity}

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "An urn with red and white beads."}
knitr::include_graphics("06-one-parameter/images/sampling_bowl_1.jpg")
```

### Using the shovel method once 

Instead of performing an exhaustive count, let's insert a shovel into the urn and remove $5 \cdot 10 = 50$ beads. We are taking a *sample* of the total population of beads. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Inserting a shovel into the urn."}
knitr::include_graphics("06-one-parameter/images/sampling_bowl_2.jpg")
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Removing 50 beads from the urn."}
knitr::include_graphics("06-one-parameter/images/sampling_bowl_3_cropped.jpg")
```

Observe that 17 of the 50 sampled beads are red and thus $17/50 = 0.34 = 34\%$ of the shovel's beads are red. We can view the proportion of beads that are red in this shovel as a guess of the proportion of beads that are red in the entire urn. While not as exact as doing an exhaustive count of all the beads in the urn, our guess of 34% took much less time and energy to make. 

Recall that $\rho$ is the true value of the proportion of red beads. There is only one $\rho$. Our guesses at the proportion of red beads are known as $\hat{\rho}$ (pronounced p hat), where $\hat{\rho}$ is the estimated value of $\rho$ which comes from taking a sample. There are many possible $\hat{\rho}$'s. You and I will often differ in our estimates. We each have a different $\hat{\rho}$ even though we agree that there is only one $\rho$.

Start this activity over from the beginning, placing the 50 beads back into the urn. Would a second sample include exactly 17 red beads? Maybe, but probably not.

What if we repeated this activity *many* times? Would our guess at the proportion of the urn's beads that are red, $\hat{\rho}$, be exactly 34% every time? Surely not. 

Let's repeat this exercise with the help of 33 groups of friends to understand how the value of $\hat{\rho}$ varies across 33 independent trials. 

### Using the shovel 33 times {#student-shovels}

Each of our 33 groups of friends will do the following: 

- Use the shovel to remove 50 beads each. 
- Count the number of red beads and compute the proportion of the 50 beads that are red.
- Return the beads into the urn.
- Mix the contents of the urn to not let a previous group's results influence the next group's. 

Each of our 33 groups of friends make note of their proportion of red beads from their sample collected. Each group then marks their proportion of their 50 beads that were red in the appropriate bin in a hand-drawn histogram as seen below.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Constructing a histogram of proportions."}
knitr::include_graphics("06-one-parameter/images/tactile_3_a.jpg")
```

Histograms allow us to visualize the *distribution* of a numerical variable. In particular, where the center of the values falls and how the values vary. A partially completed histogram of the first 10 out of 33 groups of friends' results can be seen in the figure below.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Hand-drawn histogram of first 10 out of 33 proportions."}
knitr::include_graphics("06-one-parameter/images/tactile_3_c.jpg")
```

Observe the following details in the histogram:

* At the low end, one group removed 50 beads from the urn with proportion red between 0.20 and 0.25.
* At the high end, another group removed 50 beads from the urn with proportion between 0.45 and 0.5 red.
* However, the most frequently occurring proportions were between 0.30 and 0.35 red, right in the middle of the distribution.
* The distribution is somewhat bell-shaped. 

`tactile_sample_urn` saves the results from our 33 groups of friends. 


```{r, echo = FALSE}
tactile_sample_urn <- tibble(group = c("Ilyas, Yohan", "Ellie, Terrance", "Mark, Ramses", 
                                      "Sophie, Brian", "Maeve, Josh", "Sanjana, Yuko",

                                      "Dania, Derek", "Dohyun, Estel", "Esther, Henry",
                                      "Ian, Iman", "Mia, James", "Morgan, Emily",
                                      "Frank, Clara", "Paddy, Matt", "Maddie, Brent"),
                            red_beads = c("21", "17", "21", "21", "18", "19", "19",
                                          "11", "15", "17", "16", "18", "17", "21",
                                          "15", "20", "11", "21", "15", "16", "23",
                                          "15", "18", "16", "21", "18", "17", "18",
                                          "15", "21", "21", "16", "19")) %>% 
  sample_frac() %>% 
  mutate(red_beads = as.numeric(red_beads)) %>% 
  mutate(prop_red = red_beads/50) %>% 
  mutate(group_ID = 1:33)

tactile_sample_urn
```

For each `group`, we are given their names, the number of `red_beads` they obtained, and the corresponding proportion out of 50 beads that were red, called `prop_red`. We also have an `group_ID` variable which gives each of the 33 groups a unique identifier. Each row can be viewed as one instance of a replicated activity: using the shovel to remove 50 beads and computing the proportion of those beads that are red. 

Let's visualize the distribution of these 33 proportions using `geom_histogram()` with `binwidth = 0.05`. This is a computerized and complete version of the partially completed hand-drawn histogram you saw earlier. Setting `boundary = 0.4` indicates that we want a binning scheme such that one of the bins' boundary is at 0.4. `color = "white"` modifies the color of the boundary for visual clarity. 

```{r}
tactile_sample_urn %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = prop_red)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, 
                 boundary = 0.4, 
                 color = "white") +
  
  # Add scale_y_continuous with breaks by 1, as the default shows the y-axis
  # from 1 to 10 with breaks at .5. Breaks by 1 is better for this plot, as all
  # resulting values are integers.
  
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 10, by = 1)) +
  
  # The call expression() is used to insert a mathematical expression, like
  # p-hat. The paste after expression allows us to paste text prior to said
  # expression.
  
  labs(x = expression(paste("Proportion of 50 beads that were red ", hat(rho))),
       y = "Count",
       title = "Proportions Red in 33 Samples") 
```


### What did we just do?

What we just demonstrated in this activity is the statistical concept of **sampling**. We want to know the proportion of red beads in the urn, with the urn being our **population**. Performing an exhaustive count of the red and white beads would be too time-consuming. Therefore, it is much more practical to extract a *sample* of 50 beads using the shovel. Using this sample of 50 beads, we estimated the proportion of the urn's beads that are red to be about 34%.

Moreover, because we mixed the beads before each use of the shovel, the samples were random and independent. Because each sample was drawn at random, the samples were different from each other. This is an example of  *sampling variation*. For example, what if instead of selecting 17 beads in our first sample we had selected just 11? Does that mean that the population proportion of the beads is 11/50 or 22%? No! Because we performed 33 trials we can look to our histogram, and see that the peak of the distribution occurs when $.35 < \hat{\rho} < .4$ , so it is *very likely* that the proportion of red beads in the entire population will also fall in or near this range. 

## Virtual sampling {#virtual-sampling}

We just performed a *tactile* sampling activity. We used a physical urn of beads and a physical shovel. We did this by hand so that we could develop our intuition about the ideas behind sampling. In this section, we mimic this physical sampling with *virtual* sampling, using a computer.  

### Using the virtual shovel once {#shovel-one-time}

Virtual sampling requires a virtual urn and a virtual shovel. Create a tibble named `urn`. The rows of `urn` correspond exactly to the contents of the actual urn. 

```{r}
# set.seed() ensures that the beads in our virtual urn are always in the same
# order. This ensures that the figures in the book match their written
# descriptions. We want 40% of the beads to be red.

set.seed(10)

urn <- tibble(color = c(rep("red", 400), 
                        rep("white", 600))) %>%
  
  # sample_frac() keeps all the rows in the tibble but rearranges their order.
  # We don't need to do this. A virtual urn does not care about the order of the
  # beads. But we find it aesthetically pleasing to mix them up.
  
  sample_frac() %>% 
  mutate(bead_ID = 1:1000) 

urn  
```

Observe that `urn` has `r scales::comma(nrow(urn))` rows, meaning that the urn contains 
`r scales::comma(nrow(urn))` beads. The first variable `bead_ID` is used as an *identification variable*. None of the beads in the actual urn are marked with numbers. The second variable `color` indicates whether a particular virtual bead is red or white. 

Note that in this section, we used the variable `bead_ID` to keep track of each bead in our urn, while in the last section we used `group_ID` to keep track of the samples drawn by the 33 individual teams. This is a better strategy than naming both variables `ID`, as it would be much more likely for us to get them confused later on. 

Our virtual urn needs a virtual shovel. We use `slice_sample()` and list-column mapping wizardry learned in Section \@ref(list-columns-and-map-functions) to take a sample of 50 beads from our virtual urn.  

```{r}
# Define trial_ID as one instance of us sampling 50 beads from the urn. When
# trial_ID is called within map(), we are performing slice_sample() upon our urn
# once, and taking a sample of 50 beads. 

tibble(trial_ID = 1) %>% 
  mutate(shovel = map(trial_ID, ~ slice_sample(urn, n = 50)))
```

As usual, map functions and list-columns are powerful but confusing. The `str()` function is a good way to explore a tibble with a list-column.

```{r}
tibble(trial_ID = 1) %>% 
  mutate(shovel = map(trial_ID, ~ slice_sample(urn, n = 50))) %>% 
  str()
```

There are two levels. There is one row in the tibble for each sample. So far, we have only drawn one sample. Within each row, there is a second level, the tibble which is the sample. That tibble has two variables: `trial_ID` and `color`. This is the advantage to using `slice_sample()`, because it selects all columns of our urn, whereas `sample()` can only sample from a single column. While identifying each individual bead may be irrelevant in our urn scenario, with other problems it could be very useful to have additional data about each individual.

Now let's add a column which indicates the number of red beads in the sample taken from the shovel.

<!-- DK: Is code like .$color understandable? -->
<!-- RS: I think the dollar sign operator should be understood at this point, but was thinking about asking Yuhan to include a way better explanation about the "this" operator in Chapter 5.  -->

```{r}
tibble(trial_ID = 1) %>% 
  mutate(shovel = map(trial_ID, ~ slice_sample(urn, n = 50))) %>% 
  
# To count the number of red beads in each shovel, we can use a lesser 
# known property of the sum() function: By passing in a comparison 
# expression, sum() will count the number of occurrences within a vector. 
# In this case, we count the total number occurrences of the word red
# in the color column of shovel.

  mutate(numb_red = map_int(shovel, ~ sum(.$color == "red")))
```

How does this work? R evaluates if `color == red`, and treats `TRUE` values like the number `1` and `FALSE` values like the number `0`. So summing the number of `TRUE`s and `FALSE`s is equivalent to summing `1`'s and `0`'s. In the end, this operation counts the number of beads where `color` equals "red".

Finally, calculate the proportion red by dividing `numb_red` (The number of red beads observed in the shovel), by the shovel size (We are using a shovel of size 50).

```{r}
tibble(trial_ID = 1) %>% 
  mutate(shovel = map(trial_ID, ~ slice_sample(urn, n = 50))) %>% 
  mutate(numb_red = map_int(shovel, ~ sum(.$color == "red"))) %>% 
  mutate(prop_red = numb_red / 50)
```

Careful readers will note that the `numb_red` is changing in each example above. The reason, of course, is that each block re-runs the shovel exercise, and slice_sample will return a random number of red beads. If we wanted the same number in each block, we would need to use `set.seed()` each time, always providing the same `seed` each time.

Let's now perform the virtual analog of having 33 groups of students use the sampling shovel!

### Using the virtual shovel 33 times {#shovel-33-times}

In our tactile sampling exercise in Section \@ref(sampling-activity), we had 33 groups of students use the shovel, yielding 33 samples of size 50 beads. We then used these 33 samples to compute 33 proportions. 

Let's use our virtual sampling to replicate the tactile sampling activity in a virtual format. We'll save these results in a data frame called `virtual_samples`. 

```{r}
set.seed(9)

 virtual_samples <- tibble(trial_ID = 1:33) %>%
    mutate(shovel = map(trial_ID, ~ slice_sample(urn, n = 50))) %>% 
    mutate(numb_red = map_int(shovel, ~ sum(.$color == "red"))) %>%
    mutate(prop_red = numb_red / 50) 

virtual_samples
```

Let's visualize this variation in a histogram:

```{r}
virtual_samples %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = prop_red)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, 
                 boundary = 0.4, 
                 color = "white") +
  
  # To use mathematical symbols in titles and labels, use the expression()
  # function, as here.
  
  labs(x = expression(hat(rho)),
       y = "Count",
       title = "Distribution of 33 proportions red") +
  
  # Label the y-axis in an attractive fashion. Without this code, the axis
  # labels would include 2.5, which makes no sense because all the values are
  # integers.
  
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(2, 10, 2))
```

Since `binwidth = 0.05`, this will create bins with boundaries at 0.30, 0.35, 0.45, and so on. Recall that $\hat{\rho}$ is equal to the proportion of beads which are red in each sample.

Observe that we occasionally obtained proportions red that are less than 30%. On the other hand, we occasionally obtained proportions that are greater than 45%. However, the most frequently occurring proportions were between 35% and 45%. Why do we have these differences in proportions red? Because of *sampling variation*. 

Now we will compare our virtual results with our tactile results from the previous section. Observe that both histograms are somewhat similar in their center and variation, although not identical. These slight differences are again due to random sampling variation. Furthermore, observe that both distributions are somewhat bell-shaped.


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Comparing 33 virtual and 33 tactile proportions red. Note that, though the figures differ slightly, both are centered around .35 to .45. This shows that, in both sampling distributions, the most frequently occuring proportion red is between 35% and 45%."}

# bind_rows() takes our data from virtual_samples and "binds" it with our data
# from tactile_sample_urn, resulting in one set of data for us to work with.
# Mutating to create the "type" column allows us to see which pieces of data
# come from virtual sampling and which come from tactical sampling.

facet_compare <- bind_rows(virtual_samples %>% 
                              select(trial_ID, prop_red) %>%
                              mutate(type = "Virtual sampling"), 
                           tactile_sample_urn %>% 
                             
  # Set numb_red = red_beads to make the column names in both tibbles the same.

                              mutate(type = "Tactile sampling")) %>% 
  
  # Use mutate() to alter the column factor into a factor column, rather than
  # the default character column. Calling levels() establishes our two
  # "factors". This step is here to help R interpret this column for when we

This visualization allows us to see how our results differed between our tactile and virtual urn results. As we can see, there is some variation between our results. This is not a cause for concern, as there is always expected sampling variation between results.

### Using the virtual shovel 1,000 times {#shovel-1000-times}

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "So much sampling, so little time."}
knitr::include_graphics("06-one-parameter/images/sample_bernie.png")
```

Although we took 33 samples from the urn in the previous section, we should never do that again! The advantage of modern technology is that we can use virtual simulation as many times as we choose, so we have no restrictions on resources. No longer are the days where we have to recruit our friends to tirelessly sample from the physical urn. We are now data scientists! 33 samples are useless to us. Instead, we use our simulations hundreds or thousands of times to create mathematical models that we can combine with our knowledge to answer our questions. In this section we'll examine the effects of sampling from the urn 1,000 times. 

We can reuse our code from above, making sure to replace 33 trials with 1,000.

```{r}
set.seed(9)

 virtual_samples <- tibble(trial_ID = 1:1000) %>%
    mutate(shovel = map(trial_ID, ~ slice_sample(urn, n = 50))) %>% 
    mutate(numb_red = map_int(shovel, ~ sum(.$color == "red"))) %>%
    mutate(numb_beads = map_int(shovel, ~ length(.$color))) %>% 
    mutate(prop_red = numb_red / numb_beads) 
```

Now we have 1,000 values for `prop_red`, each representing the proportion of 50 beads that are red in a sample. Using the same code as earlier, let’s visualize the distribution of these 1,000 replicates of `prop_red` in a histogram:

```{r}
virtual_samples %>% 
ggplot(aes(x = prop_red)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01, 
                 boundary = 0.4, 
                 color = "white") +
  labs(x = expression(hat(rho)),
       y = "Count",
       title = "Distribution of 1,000 proportions red") 
```

Why the empty spaces among the bars? Recall that, with only 50 beads, there are only 51 possible values for $\hat{\rho}$: 0, 0.02, 0.04, ..., 0.98, 1. A value of 0.31 or 0.47 is impossible, hence the gaps.

The most frequently occurring proportions of red beads occur, again, between 35% and 45%. Every now and then we observe proportions much higher or lower. This occurs because as we increase the number of trials, tails develop on our distribution as we are more likely to witness extreme $\hat{\rho}$ values. The symmetric, bell-shaped distribution shown in the histogram is well approximated by the *normal distribution*.

Now that we have a good understanding of virtual sampling, we can apply our knowledge to examine the effects of changing our virtual shovel size.  

### The effect of different shovel sizes {#different-shovels}

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "What happens if we use different sized shovels to sample?"}
knitr::include_graphics("06-one-parameter/images/three_shovels.png")
```

Instead of just one shovel, imagine we have three choices of shovels to extract a sample of beads with: shovels of size 25, 50, and 100. Using our newly developed tools for virtual sampling, let's unpack the effect of having different sample sizes. Start by creating a tibble with 1,000 rows, each row representing an instance of us sampling from the urn with our chosen shovel size. Then, compute the resulting 1,000 replicates of proportion red. Finally, plot the distribution using a histogram. 

```{r}
# Within slice_sample(), n = 25 represents our shovel of size 25. We also divide
# by 25 to compute the proportion red.

virtual_samples_25 <- tibble(trial_ID = 1:1000) %>% 
  mutate(shovel = map(trial_ID, ~ slice_sample(urn, n = 25))) %>% 
  mutate(numb_red = map_int(shovel, ~ sum(.$color == "red"))) %>% 
  mutate(prop_red = numb_red / 25)

virtual_samples_25 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = prop_red)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.04, 
                 boundary = 0.4, 
                 color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Proportion of 25 beads that were red", 
       title = "25") 
```

We will repeat this process with a shovel size of **50**. 

```{r}
virtual_samples_50 <- tibble(trial_ID = 1:1000) %>% 
  mutate(shovel = map(trial_ID, ~ slice_sample(urn, n = 50))) %>% 
  mutate(numb_red = map_int(shovel, ~ sum(.$color == "red"))) %>% 
  mutate(prop_red = numb_red / 50)


virtual_samples_50  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = prop_red)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.04, 
                 boundary = 0.4, 
                 color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Proportion of 50 beads that were red", 
       title = "50")  
```

We choose a bin width of .04 for all histograms to more easily compare different shovel sizes. Using a smaller bin size would result in gaps between the bars, as a shovel of size 50 has more possible $\hat{\rho}$ values than a shovel of size 25. 

Finally, we will perform the same process with 1000 replicates to map the histogram using a shovel size of **100**.


```{r}
virtual_samples_100 <- tibble(trial_ID = 1:1000) %>% 
  mutate(shovel = map(trial_ID, ~ slice_sample(urn, n = 100))) %>% 
  mutate(numb_red = map_int(shovel, ~ sum(.$color == "red"))) %>% 
  mutate(prop_red = numb_red / 100)


virtual_samples_100 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = prop_red)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.04, 
                 boundary = 0.4, 
                 color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Proportion of 100 beads that were red", 
       title = "100") 
```

For easy comparison, we present the three resulting histograms in a single row with matching x and y axes:

```{r, fig.cap = "Comparing the distributions of proportion red for different sample sizes (25, 50, 100). The important takeaway is that our center becomes more concentrated as our sample size increases, indicating a smaller standard deviation between our guesses."}

# Use bind_rows to combine the data from our three saved virtual sampling
# objects. Use mutate() in each to clarify the n as the necessary number
# of samples taken. This makes our data easier to interpret and prevents
# duplicate elements.

virtual_prop <- bind_rows(virtual_samples_25 %>% 
                            mutate(n = 25), 
                          virtual_samples_50 %>% 
                            mutate(n = 50), 
                          virtual_samples_100 %>% 
                            mutate(n = 100))

# Plot our new object with the x-axis showing prop_red. Add elements binwidth,
# boundary, and color for stylistic clarity. Use labs() to add an x-axis label
# and title. Facet_wrap() splits the graph into multiple plots by the variable
# (~n).

comparing_sampling_distributions <- ggplot(virtual_prop, aes(x = prop_red)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.04, boundary = 0.4, color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Proportion of shovel's beads that are red", 
       title = "Comparing distributions of proportions red for three different shovel sizes.") +
  facet_wrap(~ n) 

# Inspect our new faceted graph. 

comparing_sampling_distributions
```

Observe that as the sample size increases, the histogram becomes taller and narrower. This is because the *variation* of the proportion red for each sample decreases. Remember: A large variation means there are a wide range of values that can be achieved, while smaller variations are concentrated around a specific value. 

Why does variation decrease as sample size increases? If we use a large sample size like 100 or 500, our sample is much more representative of the population simply because more of the population is included. As a result, the proportion red in our sample ($\hat{\rho}$) will be closer to the population proportion ($\rho$).  On the other hand, smaller samples have much more variation because of our old friend chance. We are much more likely to have extreme samples that are not representative of our population. 

Let's attempt to visualize the concept of *variation* a different way. For each sample size, let's plot the proportion red for *all* 1,000 samples. With 3 different shovel sizes, we will have 3,000 total points, with each point representing an instance of sampling from the urn with a specific shovel size. 

```{r}
virtual_prop %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = prop_red, color = as.factor(n))) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = .15) + 
  labs(title = "Results of 1,000 samples for 3 different shovel sizes.",
       subtitle = "As shovel size increases, variation decreases.",
       y = "Proportion red in sample",
       color = "Shovel size") +
  # We do not need an x axis, because the color of the points denotes the shovel size. 
   theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank())
```

This graph illustrates the exact same concept as the histogram. With the smallest shovel size there is significant variance from sample to sample, as samples take on a wide variety of sample proportions! However, as we increase the sample size, the points become more concentrated, or less variance. 

There is also a third way to understand variation! We can be numerically explicit about the amount of variation in our three sets of 1,000 values of `prop_red` by using the *standard deviation*. A standard deviation is a summary statistic that measures the amount of variation within a numerical variable. For all three sample sizes, let's compute the standard deviation of the 1,000 proportions red.


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Comparing the number of slots in the shovel with the standard deviation of proportions red. Here, we see that standard deviation decreases with higher sample sizes. Larger sample sizes yield more precise estimates."}

# Start by performing group_by(n) to get data separated
# by our different shovel sizes. 

comparing_n_table <- virtual_prop %>% 
  group_by(n) %>% 
  
  # Take the standard deviation and mean of prop_red
  # using summarize. 
  
  summarize(sd = sd(prop_red), .groups = 'drop_last') %>% 
  
  # Rename using backslashes (with the desired) text
  # on the left and the existing column on the right.
  # This is for clarity once we create our table. 
  
  rename(`Number of slots in shovel` = n, 
         `Standard deviation of proportions red` = sd)

# Create a table using gt().

comparing_n_table  %>% 
  gt() %>% 
  
  # Use tab_header to add an appropriate title. 
  
  tab_header(title = "Comparing standard deviations of proportions red for three different shovels") %>% 
  
  # Use fmt_number() to adjust the number of desired decimals
  # in the resulting table. 
  
  fmt_number(columns = "Standard deviation of proportions red",
             decimals = 3)
```

&nbsp;

As the sample size increases, the sample to sample variation decreases, and our guesses at the true proportion of the urn's beads that are red get more precise. The larger the shovel, the more precise the result. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Variance appears everywhere in data science."}
knitr::include_graphics("06-one-parameter/images/variance_everywhere_meme.jpeg")
```

Let's take a step back from all the variance. The reality is that our code needs to be *re-factored*, as it is bad practice to make a separate tibble for each sample size. To make comparisons easier, let's attempt to put all 3 shovel sizes in the same tibble using mapping. 

```{r}
tibble(trial_ID = 1:1000) %>%
  mutate(shovel_ID = map(trial_ID, ~c(25, 50, 100))) %>%
  unnest(shovel_ID) %>%
  mutate(samples = map(shovel_ID, ~slice_sample(urn, n = .))) %>%
  mutate(num_red = map_int(samples, ~sum(.$color == "red"))) %>%
  mutate(prop_red = num_red/shovel_ID)
```

To those of us who do not completely understand mapping, do not fret! The **tidyr** package provides the `expand_grid()` function as a neat alternative. We can use `expand_grid()` and a new variable, `shovel_size`, to create a tibble which will organize our results. Instead of using 1,000 trials, let's use 3 to get a feel for the function.


```{r}
expand_grid(trial_ID = c(1:3), shovel_size = c(25, 50, 100))
```

The above sets the stage for simulating three samples for each of three different shovel sizes. Similar code as above can be used.

```{r}
expand_grid(trial_ID = c(1:3), shovel_size = c(25, 50, 100)) %>% 
  mutate(shovel = map(shovel_size, ~ slice_sample(urn, n = .))) %>% 
  mutate(numb_red = map_int(shovel, ~ sum(.$color == "red"))) %>% 
  mutate(prop_red = numb_red/shovel_size) 
```

Again, we changed the second line to use `shovel_size` rather than `trial_ID` as the mapping variable since we can no longer hard code the shovel size into the call to `slice_sample()`. Expand to 1,000 simulations for each value of `shovel_size` and finish with a calculation of standard deviation.

```{r}
expand_grid(trial_ID = c(1:1000), shovel_size = c(25, 50, 100)) %>% 
  mutate(shovel = map(shovel_size, ~ slice_sample(urn, n = .))) %>% 
  mutate(numb_red = map_int(shovel, ~ sum(.$color == "red"))) %>% 
  mutate(prop_red = numb_red/shovel_size) %>%
  group_by(shovel_size) %>% 
  summarize(st_dev_p_hat = sd(prop_red))
  
```

This is, approximately, the same result as we saw above, but with 1 re-factored tibble instead of 3 separate ones. We can also functions like `expand_grid()` in the future to make our code more concise.

Now that we have this framework, there's no need to limit ourselves to the sizes 25, 50, and 100.  Why not try all integers from 1 to 100? We can use the same code, except we'll now set `shovel_size = 1:100`.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
options(rgl.useNULL = TRUE)
library(rgl)
library(rayshader)
```

```{r, cache = TRUE}
shovels_100 <- expand_grid(trial_ID = c(1:1000), shovel_size = c(1:100)) %>% 
  mutate(shovel = map(shovel_size, ~ slice_sample(urn, n = .))) %>% 
  mutate(numb_red = map_int(shovel, ~ sum(.$color == "red"))) %>% 
  mutate(prop_red = numb_red / shovel_size) %>% 
  group_by(shovel_size) %>% 
  summarize(st_dev_p_hat = sd(prop_red))

glimpse(shovels_100)
```

Now, we have the standard deviation of `prop_red` for all shovel sizes from 1 to 100.  Let's plot that value to see how it changes as the shovel gets larger:

```{r, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE, fig.cap = "Comparing standard deviations of proportions red for 100 different shovels. The standard deviation decreases at the same rate as the square root of shovel size. The red line shows the standard error."}
shovels_100 %>%
 ggplot(aes(x = shovel_size, y = st_dev_p_hat)) +
 geom_point() +
 stat_function(aes(x = 1:100, colour = "red"),
               fun = function(.x) 1/(2 * sqrt(.x)),
               show.legend = FALSE) +
 labs(x = "Shovel size",
      y = "Standard deviation of the proportion red")
```

The red line here represents an important statistical concept: standard error (SE). As the shovel size increases, and thus our sample size increases, we find that the standard error decreases.  If this is confusing right now, fear not! We will delve into the explanation of standard error in our next section. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "To any poets and philosophers confused about this: don't worry! It won't be on a problem set."}
knitr::include_graphics("06-one-parameter/images/meme_math.png")
```

This is the power of running many analyses at once using map functions and list columns: before, we could tell that the standard deviation was decreasing as the shovel size increased, but when only looking at shovel sizes of 25, 50, and 100, it wasn't clear *how quickly* it was decreasing.

## Standard error {#standard-errors}

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap= "Standard errors are just the way old people talk about confidence intervals.", fig.align= 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("06-one-parameter/images/old_man_SE.png")
```

*Standard errors (SE) quantify the effect of sampling variation on our estimates.* In other words, they quantify how much we can expect the calculated proportions of a shovel's beads that are red *to vary* from one sample to another sample to another sample, and so on. As a general rule, as sample size increases, the standard error decreases.

*The standard error is the standard deviation of a sample statistic (aka point estimate), such as the proportion.* For example, the *standard error of the mean* refers to the standard deviation of the distribution of sample means taken from a population. 

The relationship between the standard error and the standard deviation is that, for a given sample size, *the standard error equals the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size*. Accordingly, the standard error is inversely proportional to the sample size. The larger the sample size, the smaller the standard error. 

If this sounds confusing, don't worry! It is. Before we can explain this in more depth, it is important to understand some terminology. 

### Terminology and notation {#terminology-and-notation}

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Let Yoda's wisdom dull the pain of this terminology section."}
knitr::include_graphics("06-one-parameter/images/yoda.png")
```

All of the concepts underlying this terminology, notation, and definitions tie directly to the concepts underlying our tactile and virtual sampling activities. It will simply take time and practice to master them. 

First, a **population** is the set of relevant units. The population's size is upper-case $N$.  In our sampling activities, the population is the collection of $N$ = 1,000 identically sized red and white beads in the urn. This is about the simplest possible population. Other examples are all the adult men in the US, all the classrooms in a school, all the wheelbarrows in Massachusetts, all the values of your blood pressure, read at five minute intervals, for your entire life. Often, the population is extends over time, as with your blood pressure readings and is, therefore, more amorphous. Consider all the people who have run for governor of a US state since 1900, or all the people who will run for governor through 2050. Those are also populations.

Second, a **population parameter** is a numerical summary quantity about the population that is unknown, but you wish you knew. For example, when this quantity is the mean, the population parameter of interest is the *population mean*. This is mathematically denoted with the Greek letter $\mu$ pronounced "mu." In our earlier sampling from the urn activity, however, since we were interested in the *proportion* of the urn's beads that were red, the population parameter is the *population proportion*, denoted with $\rho$. 

Third, a **census** is an exhaustive enumeration or counting of all $N$ units in the population in order to compute the population parameter's value *exactly*. In our sampling activity, this would correspond to counting the number of beads out of $N = 1000$ that are red and computing the *population proportion* $\rho$ that are red *exactly*. When the number $N$ of individuals or observations in our population is large as was the case with our urn, a census can be quite expensive in terms of time, energy, and money. A census is impossible for any populations which includes the future, like our blood pressure next year or candidates for governor in 2040. There is a *truth* but we could not, even in theory, calculate it.

Fourth, **sampling** is the act of collecting a sample from the population when we can not, or do not want to, perform a census. The sample size is lower case $n$, as opposed to upper case $N$ for the population's size. Typically the sample size $n$ is much smaller than the population size $N$. In our sampling activities, we used shovels with varying slots to extract samples of size $n$ = 1 through $n$ = 100. 

Fifth, a **point estimate**, also known as a **sample statistic**, is a measure computed from a sample that *estimates* an unknown population parameter. In our sampling activities, recall that the unknown population parameter was the proportion of red beads and that this is mathematically denoted with $\rho$. Our point estimate is the *sample proportion*: the proportion of the shovel's beads that are red. In other words, it is our guess at the proportion of the urn's beads that are red. The point estimate of the parameter $\rho$ is $\hat{\rho}$. The "hat" on top of the $\rho$ indicates that it is an estimate of the unknown population proportion $\rho$. 

<!-- RS: consider moving last 4 definitions to end discussion about sampling mechanisms, and first 4 definitions to the very start of the chapter. This vocab (with exception of point statistics) doesn't really have a purpose here, and should be used in a section where the words are actually used.  -->

Sixth, a sample is said to be **representative** if it roughly *looks like* the population. In other words, are the sample's characteristics a good representation of the population's characteristics? In our sampling activity, are the samples of $n$ beads extracted using our shovels representative of the urn's $N$ = 1000 beads?

Seventh, a sample is **generalizable** if any results based on the sample can generalize to the population. In our sampling activity, can we generalize the sample proportion from our shovels to the entire urn? Using our mathematical notation, this is akin to asking if $\hat{\rho}$ is a "good guess" of $\rho$?

Eighth, **biased sampling** occurs if certain individuals or observations in a population have a higher chance of being included in a sample than others. We say a sampling procedure is **unbiased** if every observation in a population had an equal chance of being sampled. Had the red beads been much smaller than the white beads, and therefore more prone to falling out of the shovel, our sample would have been **biased**. In our sampling activities, since we mixed all $N = 1000$ beads prior to each group's sampling and since each of the equally sized beads had an equal chance of being sampled, our samples were unbiased.

Ninth, a sampling procedure is *random* if we sample randomly from the population in an unbiased fashion. In our sampling activities, this would correspond to sufficiently mixing the urn before each use of the shovel. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap = "Fear not if you look like Spongebob after reading this section. We will re-cap right now!"}
knitr::include_graphics("06-one-parameter/images/cant_breathe_sponge.png")
```


**In general:**

* If the sampling of a sample of size $n$ is done at **random**, then
* the sample is **unbiased** and **representative** of the population of size $N$, thus
* any result based on the sample can **generalize** to the population, thus
* the point estimate is a **"good guess"** of the unknown population parameter, thus
* instead of performing a **census**, we can draw inferences about the population using **sampling**.

**Specific to our sampling activity:**

* If we extract a sample of $n=50$ beads at **random**, in other words, we mix all of the equally sized beads before using the shovel, then
* the contents of the shovel are an **unbiased representation** of the contents of the urn's 1000 beads, thus
* any result based on the shovel's beads can **generalize** to the urn, thus
* the sample proportion $\hat{\rho}$ of the $n=50$ beads in the shovel that are red is a **"good guess"** of the population proportion $\rho$ of the $N=1000$ beads that are red, thus
* instead of manually going over all 1,000 beads in the urn, we can make **inferences** about the urn by using the results from the shovel. 


### Statistical definitions {#sampling-definitions}

Now, for some important statistical definitions related to sampling. As a refresher of our 1,000 repeated/replicated virtual samples of size $n$ = 25, $n$ = 50, and $n$ = 100 in Section \@ref(virtual-sampling), let's display our figure showing the difference in proportions red according to different shovel sizes.  

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Previously seen three distributions of the sample proportion $\\hat{\rho}$."}
comparing_sampling_distributions
```

These types of distributions have a special name: **sampling distributions**; their visualization displays the effect of sampling variation on the distribution of a point estimate; in this case, the sample proportion $\hat{\rho}$. Using these sampling distributions, for a given sample size $n$, we can make statements about what values we typically expect. 

For example, observe the centers of all three sampling distributions: they are all roughly centered around $0.4 = 40\%$. Furthermore, observe that while we are somewhat likely to observe sample proportions of red beads of $0.2 = 20\%$ when using the shovel with 25 slots, we will almost never observe a proportion of 20% when using the shovel with 100 slots. Observe also the effect of sample size on the sampling variation. As the sample size $n$ increases from 25 to 50 to 100, the variation of the sampling distribution decreases and thus the values cluster more and more tightly around the same center of around 40%. We quantified this variation using the standard deviation of our sample proportions, seeing that the standard deviation decreases with the square root of the sample size:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Previously seen comparing standard deviations of proportions red for 100 different shovels"}
shovels_100 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = shovel_size, y = st_dev_p_hat)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Shovel size",
       y = "Standard deviation of the proportion red")
```

So as the sample size increases, the standard deviation of the proportion of red beads decreases. This type of standard deviation has another special name: **standard error**

### What is a "standard error"?

The "standard error" (SE) is a term that measures the accuracy with which a sample distribution represents a population through the use of standard deviation. Specifically, SE is used to refer to the standard deviation of a sample statistic (aka point estimate), such as the mean or median. For example, the "standard error of the mean" refers to the standard deviation of the distribution of sample means taken from a population. 

> In statistics, a sample mean deviates from the actual mean of a population; this deviation is the standard error of the mean. 

Many students struggle to differentiate the standard error from the standard deviation.  The relationship between the standard error and the standard deviation is such that, for a given sample size, the standard error equals the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. Accordingly, the standard error is inversely proportional to the sample size; the larger the sample size, the smaller the standard error because the statistic will approach the actual value. 

<!-- Insert visual aid for students who are not mathematically inclined showing that larger sample sizes = closer to actual value -->

The more data points involved in the calculations of the mean, the smaller the standard error tends to be. When the standard error is small, the data is said to be more representative of the true mean. In cases where the standard error is large, the data may have some notable irregularities. Thus, larger sample size = smaller standard error = more representative of the truth. 

To help reinforce these concepts, let's re-display our previous figure but using our new sampling terminology, notation, and definitions:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Three sampling distributions of the sample proportion $\\hat{\rho}$. Note the increased concentration on the bins around .4 as our sample size increases."}
p_hat_compare <- virtual_prop %>% 
  mutate(
    n = str_c("n = ", n),
    n = factor(n, levels = c("n = 25", "n = 50", "n = 100"))
    ) %>% 
  ggplot( aes(x = prop_red)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, boundary = 0.4, color = "white") +
  labs(x = expression(paste("Sample proportion ", hat(rho))), 
       title = expression(paste("Sampling distributions of ", hat(rho), " based on n = 25, 50, 100.")) ) +
  facet_wrap(~ n)
if(knitr::is_latex_output()){
  p_hat_compare  +
  theme(
    strip.text = element_text(colour = 'black'),
    strip.background = element_rect(fill = "grey93")
  )
} else {
  p_hat_compare
}
```

Furthermore, let's display the graph of standard errors for $n = 1$ to $n = 100$ using our new terminology, notation, and definitions relating to sampling.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Standard errors of the sample proportion based on sample sizes of 1 to 100"}
shovels_100 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = shovel_size, y = st_dev_p_hat)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Sample size (n)",
       y = expression(Standard~error~of~hat(italic(rho))))
```

Remember the key message of this last table: that as the sample size $n$ goes up, the "typical" error of your point estimate will go down, as quantified by the *standard error*.

### The moral of the story {#moral-of-the-story}

If we could only know two pieces of information from our data, what would they be? First, you need a measure of the **center** of the distribution. This would include the mean or median, which shows the center of our data points. Second, we need a measure of the **variability** of the distribution. To understand our center, we must understand how different (or how spread) our data points are from one another. Thus, we need a measure like sd() or MAD. These are summary statistics which are necessary to understanding a distribution. Do those two figures encompass all you need to know about a distribution? No! But, if you are only allowed two numbers to keep, those are the most valuable. 

> The mean or median is a good estimate for the center of the posterior and the standard error or mad is a good estimate for the variability of the posterior, with +/- 2 standard errors covering 95% of the outcomes.

The standard error measures the accuracy of a sample distribution as compared to the population by using the standard deviation. Specifically, the standard deviation of our data points divided by the square root of the sample size. As such, we find that larger sample sizes = lower standard errors = more accurate and representative guesses. 

To really drive home our point: standard error is just a fancy term for your uncertainty about something you don't know. Standard error == our (uncertain) beliefs. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap= "If you are wondering how much you need to know, follow this helpful guide of the information we have learned this chapter!", fig.align= 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("06-one-parameter/images/final_preceptor.png")
```

<!-- RS: Pyramid is not super helpful and I support removing it and all references to it.  -->

This hierarchy represents the knowledge we need to understand standard error (SE). At the bottom, we have math. It's the foundation for our understanding, but it doesn't need to be what we take away from this lesson. As we go up, we simplify the topic. The top of the pyramid are the basic levels of understanding that will help you to remember in the future. 

If I know your estimate plus or minus *two* standard errors, I know your 95% confidence interval. This is valuable information. Standard error is really just a measure for how uncertain we are about something we do not know, the thing we are estimating. When we recall SE, we should remember that, all in all, it's a complicated concept that can be distilled into: the way old people talk about confidence intervals. 

<!-- RS: Explain what confidence interval is.  -->

Recall that $\hat{\rho}$ is the estimated value of p which comes from taking a sample. There can be billions and billions of $\hat{\rho}$'s. We look at a large group of $\hat{\rho}$'s, create a distribution of results to represent the possible values of p based on our findings, and then we compute a standard error to account for our own uncertainty about our predictions. Our 95% confidence interval for our prediction == our estimate plus or minus **two** standard errors. 

In regards to the fifth layer of the hierarchy, we may wonder: 

> "I thought that MADs were the same thing as standard deviations. Now you say they are the same things as standard errors. Which is it?"  

MADs and standard deviations are, more or less, the same thing. They are both measures of the **variability** of a distribution. In most cases, they have very similar values. A *standard error* is also a standard deviation. Specifically, it is the standard deviation of the distribution of the estimates, and that distribution of estimates is, more or less, your posterior. Therefore, we can use MAD, like standard error, to describe that distribution and the variability of that distribution. 


## Cardinal Virtues

Recall the questions we asked at the beginning of this Chapter: 

>If we get 17 red beads in a random sample of size 50 taken from a mixed urn, what proportion $\rho$ of the beads in the urn are red?

>What is the probability, using the same urn, that we will draw more than 8 red beads if we use a shovel of size 20?

Use the Cardinal Virtues to guide your thinking. 

### Wisdom

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/Wisdom.jpg")
```

Wisdom requires the creation of a Preceptor Table, an examination of our data, and a determination as to whether or not we can (reasonably!) assume that the two come from the same *population*.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "When you see another Precetor Table section."}
knitr::include_graphics("06-one-parameter/images/here_we_go.png")
```

A Preceptor Table is a table with rows and columns, such that, if no data is missing, we can easily answer our questions. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tibble(bead_ID = c("1", "2", 
                   "...", "200", "201", "...", "2078", "2079", "..."),
       color = c("white", "white", 
                   "...", "red", "white", "...", "red", "white", "...")) %>%
  gt() %>%
    tab_header(title = "Preceptor Table") %>% 
    cols_label(bead_ID = "ID",
               color = "Color") %>%
    tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
              location = cells_body(columns = c(bead_ID))) %>%
    cols_align(align = "center", columns = everything())
```

&nbsp;

Note that the beads do not have ID numbers printed on them. The numbering is arbitrary. Having an ID just reminds us that there are actual units under consideration, even if we can not tell them apart, other than by color. We also include the ID to help visualize the fact that we don't know the total number of beads in the urn, because our question never tells us! There could be 1,000 beads like our physical urn from earlier, or there could be a million beads. The ellipse at the bottom of the Preceptor Table denotes our uncertainty regarding urn size. 

There is only one outcome column, "Color," because this is not a causal model, for which we need to have (at least) two potential outcomes. Predictive models require only one outcome.

If we know the color of every bead, then calculating the proportion of beads which are red, $\rho$, is simple algebra. Once we know $\rho$ we can simulate the answers to other questions.

<!-- DK: That is fairly quick. Answering our second question, even with perfect knowledge of rho is non-trivial. Ignore that complexity for now. -->

<!-- RS: Added back elipses at bottom, because I am trying to make it uniform across the chapter that there is alot we don't know about the urn because we can never access it physically.  -->

The data we have, unfortunately, only provides the color for 50 beads. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Actual Preceptor Table to be created by the very helpful Cass!

tibble(bead_ID = c("2", "...", 
                   "200", "...", "2079", "..."),
       color = c("white", "...", "red", 
                 "...", "white", "...")) %>%
  gt() %>%
    tab_header(title = "Data from Shovel") %>% 
    cols_label(bead_ID = "ID",
               color = "Color") %>%
    tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
              location = cells_body(columns = c(bead_ID))) %>%
    cols_align(align = "center", columns = everything())
```

&nbsp;

Again, there are no ID numbers. But keeping track of which beads were in the sample and which beads were not is helpful.

The last step of Wisdom is to consider whether or not we can consider the units from the Preceptor Table and the units from the data to have been drawn from the same *population*. In this case, as with many sampling scenarios, it is trivial that we may make this assumption. If all the rows from the data are also rows in the Preceptor Table, we may assume that they are drawn from the same distribution.

<!-- DK: Could expand on this point. -->

We also consider why some beads do get sampled, while others do not. This is a consequence of the *sampling mechanism*. We hope that our sampling mechanism has near equal access to all members of the population, or else our samples would be biased. Almost all samples have some bias, but we must make a judgement call to see if the data we have is close enough to the data we want (i.e., the Preceptor Table) that we can consider both as coming from the same population. Our sample of 50 beads is taken from a *mixed* urn, so hopefully there is a near equal chance of selecting each bead, and our samples are representative of the population. 

<!-- Could get into more details here, e.g., Sometimes, the Preceptor Table and the Population Table have the same number of rows. This happens when all the data arfe rows from the Preceptor Table. Example would be the simple case of an urn, the beads in which you know do not change color, and from which you have drawn a sample. But, what if beads can change color? Then the data from the sample 10 minutes ago has a less than certain relationship with the Preceptor Table. The same includes the color for bead 96 ten minites ago. The Preceptor Table has one row for bead 96 now, at this moment. So, in this case, the Population Table has a row for every bead at each moment in time that we care about. At the very least, it as 1,000 rows for 10 minutes ago (when we took the sample) and 1,000 rows for now. -->

<!-- RS: Expanded on above comment alot in Pop. Table section (definetly too much detail), would appreciate suggestions on how to reformat to be concise. I pride my explanation for being best in the primer, so I feel like we need to keep a detailed explanation either here or move to Ch. 4 or 5.   -->

### Justice

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/Justice.jpg")
```

Justice starts with the construction of a Population Table. We use this table to explore the issues of validity, stability and representativeness. We then make an assumption about the *form* of the data generating mechanism.

#### Population Table

The *Population Table* includes rows from three sources: the data for units we want to have (the Preceptor Table), the data for units which we have (our actual data), and the data for units we do not care about (the rest of the population, not included in the data or the Preceptor Table).

<!-- RS: I choose to capitalize Data to emphasize that it is one of the categories, but let me know if this is incorrect.  -->

<!-- DK: Make this table correctly. Add a "Time" column. Only four columns: Source, Time, ID and Color. First rows from Population, then Data, than Population, then Preceptor Table, then Population. Time goes in 10 minute increments. Time Preceptor Table is "Now". Time for Population at end is "Now + 10". Time for Data is "Now - 10". -->

<!-- RS: Wouldn't population time be both Now + 10 and Now - 10? I also think ? marks would also be less confusing.  -->

<!-- Use same rows (including same ID and Color) from Data table. Done.-->

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tibble(source = c("Preceptor Table", "Preceptor Table", "...",
                  "Actual Data", "Actual Data", "Actual Data", "...",
                  "Population", "Population", "Population"),
       location = c("Known, specific urn", "Known, specific urn", "...",
                  "Known, specific urn", "Known, specific urn", "Known, specific urn", "...",
                  "Known, specific urn", "Known, specific urn", "Known, specific urn"),
       time = c("Now", "Now", "...",
                "Time of sample", "Time of sample", "Time of sample", "...",
                "?", "?", "?"),
       id = c("?", "?", "...",
                 "2", "200", "2079", "...",
                 "?", "?", "?"),
       color = c("?", "?", "...",
                 "white", "red", "white", "...",
                 "?", "?", "?")) %>%

  # Then, we use the gt function to make it pretty

  gt() %>%
  cols_label(source = md("Source"),
             location = md("Location"),
             time = md("Time"),
             id = md("ID"),
             color = md("Color")) %>%
  tab_style(cell_borders(sides = "right"),
            location = cells_body(columns = c(source))) %>%
  tab_style(style = cell_text(align = "left", v_align = "middle", size = "large"),
            locations = cells_column_labels(columns = c(source))) %>%
  cols_align(align = "center", columns = everything()) %>%
  cols_align(align = "left", columns = c(source)) %>%
  fmt_markdown(columns = everything())
```

&nbsp;

Each specific row represents one subject, which are individual beads in our urn scenario. Because there could be thousands or even millions of beads, we provide 2-3 examples for each category, and use an elipse to denote that there are many more subjects that we have yet to record. 

Each Population Table will have a minimum of 3 types of columns: covariates, time, and outcome(s). We will explain these columns for each type of category (Preceptor Table, Data, and Population). 

**Covariates** can be thought of as demographics. People have an age, race, height, weight, location where they live ... you get the point. When we construct a Preceptor Table to answer our question, we must select some covariates that we **want** all of our subjects to have. To answer our questions, we in theory should collect data from subjects with our desired covariates. However, life is tough, and the data we get is not always ideal. Our urn scenario only has one covariate: location. Rather intuitively, urns can have drastically different contents, so to easily answer our question it's important to identify the location of one specific urn for which to find the proportion red. Let's break down the location column in the Preceptor Table, Data, and Population categories. 

- Preceptor Table: Subjects in our Preceptor Table all have a location of "Known, specific urn." This is because we want to find the proportion red of one specific urn, so ideally all of our data should come from this urn.

- Data: Ideally, we want our data to have the same covariates as our Preceptor Table. Because we draw our sample from the exact same urn our question asks us about, the data we collect comes directly from the Preceptor Table, so they have the same location ("Known, specific urn"). This is the perfect scenario for us, but this rarely occurs in real life. For example, let's put ourselves inside the *Hunger Games*, where 12 districts each draw from a separate urn to select their tributes to fight to the death. What if we **want** to know the mean age of tributes selected in District 11 (The Preceptor Table), but instead we are only given data from Districts 9 and 10 (Data). In this scenario, the location of subjects in the Preceptor Table and the Data differ because the urns are located in two separate districts. 

- Population: In our urn scenario, the location of subjects in the Preceptor Table and Data are the same, so the Population will also have the same location. Again, covariates from the Preceptor Table and Data are rarely identical in real life. Returning to our *Hunger Games* example, we want data from District 11 to fill in our Preceptor Table, but we are only given data from districts 9 and 10. If we wish to draw conclusions about District 11 using Districts 9 and 10, what stops us from using Districts 1 and 2 instead? Or maybe Districts 3 and 7? **We use the Population to acknowledge the wider source we could have collected data from.** Assuming all 12 districts are similar, we really could have used data from any 2, so our location covariate for the Population should be: "All districts". On the other hand, for our urn problem there is only one urn which we could data collect from, so we know the location of our Population. 

Population Tables always have a column for **time**. When answering a question we must specify the time that it's being asked, because life changes over time.

- Preceptor Table: Because the question does not specify otherwise, we should assume that we want to find the proportion of red beads at this instant. As such, subjects in our Preceptor Table category have a time of "Now". 

- Data: Unfortunately, we collected our sample (17 out of 50 beads are red) in the past. We ideally want to know the contents of our sample at this very instant to answer our question, but we do not have the resources to whip out an urn for every new question we have. The best we can do is acknowledge that the data we have does not fill in our Preceptor Table perfectly, because it was collected from a sample in the past. Some of us may believe that making this distinction is ridiculous, as an urn does not change over time! However, it is possible that someone could have dumped some extra red beads into the urn after taking our sample. If this is the case, then our data only reflects the contents of the urn in the past, and not the urn now. 

- Population: Remember, we use the Population to acknowledge the wider source we could have collected data from. Let's say that we took our sample in 2016. What prevents us from using a sample taken in 2014? How about 2018? Because there are in fact an infinite number of times (down to the millisecond) that we could have taken our sample, we mark the time in the Population category with a ?. We hope that the urn hasn't changed much over time, but acknowledge that we could have taken our sample at many different times, amassing to a much larger Population than we may have originally thought.  

Finally, Population Tables have an **outcome**. Sometimes there will be multiple outcome columns, like in the case of casual models where we ideally want data on a subject before and after treatment. In our urn problem, we only two outcomes: bead ID and bead color. 

- Preceptor Table: To find the exact proportion red in our urn, we simply divide the number of red beads in the urn by the total number of beads. However, we do not know the colors (or IDs) of each individual bead in our urn, so we mark this information with a ?. Because our data has all the same covariates as our Preceptor Table (which is very unrealistic) we actually do know the colors and IDs of 50 beads in our Preceptor Table, but we list 2 beads that were not sampled in our Population Table for simplicity's sake. 

- Data: We sampled 50 beads from the urn and recorded their colors. As such, we know the outcomes of our data, and can fill in the column. 

- Population: The wider population from which we could have collected data from includes all beads in the urn at many times throughout the past (and the future). Because we don't know all bead colors in the urn (especially if the urn has changed over time), we mark the Outcome column of the Population category with ?s. 

#### Validity, stability, and representativeness

Now that we have created our Population Table, we can analyze some key issues: validity, stability, and representativeness.  

*Validity* involves the columns of our data set. Is the meaning of our columns consistent across the different data sources? In our urn scenario, does bead color in our sampled data and bead color in our Preceptor Table mean the same thing? The answer is yes, and validity can be assumed very easily. If some beads in the urn are old and the color has worn off, it may be more difficult to conclude whether the color column always means the same thing. 

*Stability* involves time. Is the model --- meaning both the mathematical formula and the value of the parameters --- stable over time? Realistically, an urn will always be the same over time. However, what if someone dumps some red beads into the urn after we take our sample? Then we cannot assume stability, because the proportion of red beads in the urn, $\rho$, the instant before the dump is different than the proportion red in the urn after. We will assume no one is tampering with our urn, and assert stability across time periods. 

*Representativeness* involves the data rows, specifically the rows for which we have data versus the rows which *might have been*. Are the rows that we do have data for representative of the rows for which we do not have data? For the sample proportion to be similar to the actual population proportion, we ideally want the data we have to be a random, unbiased selection from our population, using a considerable sample size. In the context of our problem, the sampling mechanism of using a shovel of size 50 to sample beads from an urn in which the beads are thoroughly mixed should be enough to consider our sample representative of the population, and we can move on. 

#### The DGM

The final aspect of Justice is assuming/creating a mathematical formula --- a *data generating mechanism*, or DGM --- which mimics the process by which the data comes to us. The DGM for sampling scenarios with only two possible values is often denoted as follows: 

$$ T_i  \sim B(\rho, n = 50) $$

The total number of red beads selected in a sample of 50 beads, $T_i$, is equal to one draw from a binomial distribution with $n = 50$ observations and an unknown probability $\rho$ of the proportion of red beads in the urn.

### Courage

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("other/images/Courage.jpg")
```

We've evaluated our data and questions and chosen a mathematical formula. Now it's time to work on our code to create a model that can simulate the real world. 

#### Bayesian framework

<!-- RS: I'm protesting! I really like this section.  -->

We are Bayesian data scientists that make Bayesian models. This means that we make specific assumptions and consider different things to be either fixed or variable compared to other data science frameworks. One of the most important distinctions is that in Bayesian data science, **we don't know the values of our parameters**. Consider the DGM created in Justice: 

$$ T_i  \sim B(\rho, n = 50) $$

Some non-Bayesian frameworks are concerned with the probability distribution of our observed data, but do not care much about the probability distribution for $\rho$ and assume it to be fixed. If $\rho$ is fixed, the equation above becomes one simple binomial distribution. Think of this as a standard 2 dimensional plot. 

Us Bayesians consider our observed data to be fixed. We don't consider alternate realities where our observed data is different due to sampling variation. Instead, we are concerned with the probability distribution of our parameter. In our urn scenario, $\rho$ is variable, so we have to create a separate binomial distribution for each possible value of $\rho$. Think of this as a 3 dimensional joint distribution like what we created in Section \@ref(n-models).

It is essential to understand the joint distribution and the posterior, two concepts Bayesians use to solve problems. We will provide quick a quick review here, including statistical notation that may be helpful to some. 

**The joint distribution**, $p(y|\theta)$, models the outcome $y$ given one or more unknown parameter(s), $\theta$. The equation illustrates exact same concept we addressed while discussing the distinctions of Bayesian science: because our parameters are variable, we have to create separate distributions for each potential value. Combining all these distributions together creates a joint distribution that is 3 dimensional when plotted. 

**The posterior**, $p(\theta|y)$, is the probability distribution of our parameter(s) $\theta$, created using data $y$ that updates our beliefs. We have referenced the posterior many times before, and this definition does not change its meaning. 

In our urn scenario, obtaining the posterior involves first creating many binomial distributions for each possible population proportion. This is the joint distribution, and it is a 3 dimensional model. We then select the distribution that corresponds with our data: 17 red beads are sampled. We can represent the posterior with the following:

$$\text{Prob}(\text{models} | \text{data} = 17)$$

This is equivalent to taking a 2 dimensional slice of the 3 dimensional model. We are left with a probability distribution for our parameter, $\rho$. 

#### stan_glm()

Given a data set to use and a mathematical formula to work with, the next step is to write some code. We will use the **rstanarm** package, which provides a user friendly interface to work with the statistical language Stan. 

**rstanarm** and Stan are appealing because they are powerful. Functions such as `stan_glm()` can do everything we did by hand in Chapter 5 in a few lines of code. Because we will use a professional statistical library, the objects we make will become more complex. In this Chapter, we provide the steps for answering our questions. Chapter \@ref(two-parameters) will provide a more detailed explanation of the objects we will make. *To be clear, you do not need to fully understand this section or how this code works. This is an introduction, not a formal lesson.*


```{r, message = FALSE}
library(rstanarm)

fit_1 <- stan_glm(formula = red ~ 1, 
                  data = tibble(red = c(rep(1, 17), 
                                        rep(0, 33))),
                  family = binomial,
                  refresh = 0,
                  seed = 10) 
```


Recall that we assumed a binomial model for the data generating mechanism.  In `stan_glm()` we denote this with `family = binomial`. In addition to the type of the distribution, we also need to analyze the outcome and predictor variables involved. The outcome is the quantity we are measuring, in this case the total number of red beads in our sample.  Because we have no predictors, we use the argument `formula = red ~ 1`, which means that we only model the outcome based on the unknown proportion of red beads in the urn, $\rho$. 

We pass in data in a binomial format: the 1's represent the number of successes (red beads drawn), and the 0's represent the number of failures (white beads drawn). As such, we pass a tibble with 17 red beads and 33 white beads into `data`. 

We use `refresh = 0` to suppress the behavior of printing to the console, and `seed = 10` so that we get the same output every time we run the code. The resulting model is:

```{r}
fit_1
```

We will learn the meaning of this output in Chapter \@ref(two-parameters). Once we have the `fit_1` object, it is easy to answer two sorts of questions: the posterior probability distribution for $\rho$ and predictions for new draws from the urn. The key new functions are `posterior_epred()` for the former and `posterior_predict()` for the latter.
 
Let's recreate our posterior using `posterior_epred()`:

```{r}
ppd_for_p <- posterior_epred(fit_1, 
                newdata = tibble(constant = 1)) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>%
  rename(p = `1`)
  
# posterior_epred() will unhelpfully name the column of our tibble to "1". We
# have two options: either refer to the column name as `1`, or rename the column
# to make it less confusing. We will rename the column to "p" in this chapter, but you
# will oftentimes see `1` in later chapters.

ppd_for_p
```

Because we do not wish to create our distribution conditional on some covariate, we want to pass in a tibble with 1 row into the `newdata` argument. An empty tibble has 0 rows, so we instead pass in a tibble with some junk data. `constant = 1` is completely meaningless. Now we plot the result:   

```{r}
ppd_for_p %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = p)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),
                   bins = 50) + 
    labs(title = "Posterior Probability Distribution",
         subtitle = "Distribution is centered at .34",
         x = "Proportion p of Red Beads in Urn",
         y = "Probability") + 
  
    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::number_format()) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
    theme_classic()
```

We have successfully created the posterior distribution and can finally answer the question we started the chapter with: 

>If we get 17 red beads in a random sample of size 50 taken from a mixed urn, what proportion $\rho$ of the beads in the urn are red?

Look to the distribution we have created! We can see that the bulk of the area under the posterior occurs approximately when $\rho$ is between .28 and .42, so the answer to our question is that it is likely that 28% to 42% of the beads in the urn in the red. Another reader may believe that the bulk of the area under the posterior occurs when $\rho$ is between .25 and .45, and may conclude it likely that 25% to 45% of beads are red. They would be perfectly correct! Any range that is large enough to acknowledge the uncertainty we have regarding the exact value of $\rho$ is acceptable. 

Although the most likely probability (the highest bar on the histogram) occurs when $\rho$ is around .32, The answer is not a single number. Our posterior distribution is just that: a distribution. From our sample, we have many different results for the proportion of red beads in the entire urn. Certain proportions, like the extremes close to 0% or 100%, are essentially impossible due to our sample value being 34%. On the other hand, we could have just as easily sampled 16 or 18 beads from the urn, and sample proportions such as 32% and 36% are very plausible.

This means that, while we can provide a range of possibilities (and we can estimate which of those possibilities occur most frequently), we can never say that we know the total number of red beads with certainty.  We know that there is the most chance that $\rho$ is between .28 and about .42, some chance that $\rho$ is between .15 and .24 or between .42 and .56, and almost no chance that $\rho$ is below .15 or above .56. With the posterior we can visualize all of these probabilities at once. 

Another important question remains: 

> Why are there 4,000 rows in the stan_glm() tibble?

By default, `stan_glm()` will sample from the posterior in 2 sets of 2,000 iterations. If needed we can change the default number of iterations using the `iter` argument, but there are few reasons to do so. Some of us may still want to know why we sample from the posterior in the first place. Why not use the entire posterior? The answer is that the posterior is a theoretical beast, which makes it difficult to work with. 

For example, what if we wanted to know the probability that $\rho$ is between .3 and .4? To answer this using the pure posterior, we would need to calculate the area under the distribution from when $.3 < \rho < .4$. This is more difficult then it seems, as the posterior is a distribution, so it has no individual observations to work with as it's continuous! 

Instead, we can work with draws from the posterior. With enough draws we create a close approximation of the posterior which models the counts of our observations. This is an *approximation*; it is not exactly the posterior, but close enough for our purposes. We can easily convert our posterior distribution into a **posterior probability distribution**, by making the area under the graph sum to 1. The posterior probability distribution is often used as a visual aid, as percentages are more easy to conceptualize than raw numbers. One way to convert a posterior distribution into a probability distribution is to group by each value of $\rho$ and turn the counts into probabilities: 

```{r}
ppd_for_p %>%
  round(digits = 2) %>%
  group_by(p) %>%
  summarize(prob = n()/nrow(ppd_for_p)) %>%
  arrange(desc(prob))
```

We can also accomplish a similar effect by passing `aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))` into `geom_histogram()` when plotting.  Oftentimes, like in answering the probability that $\rho$ is between .3 and .4,  we can work with the posterior distribution to the very end. Just divide the number of draws that meet our condition (are between .3 and .4), by the total number of draws.   

```{r}
sum(ppd_for_p$p > .3 & ppd_for_p$p < .4)/nrow(ppd_for_p)
```

There is approximately a 54% chance that $\rho$ is between .3 and .4. Give me draws from the posterior and I can show you the world!

### Temperance

With the fitted model object `fit_1`, we can now make predictions into the future and answer our questions.

Recall the second question we started with:

>What is the probability, using the same urn, that we will draw more than 8 red beads if we use a shovel of size 20?

#### Using the posterior

Whenever someone asks you a question, you need to decide what posterior probability distribution would make it easy for you to answer that question. In this case, if we know the posterior probability distribution for the number of red beads in a shovel of size 20, then a question about the likelihood of drawing more than 8 (or any other value) is easy to answer.

The posterior probability distribution for a probability is a tricky thing. It is much easier just to estimate the posterior probability distribution for the outcome --- number of red beads out of 20 --- and then work with that distribution in order to answer probability-type questions.

To predict these future unknown samples, we use `posterior_predict()`. We pass the posterior created using `stan_glm()` as the first argument, and because we want to estimate the number of red draws with a shovel size of 20, we use pass a tibble with 20 rows into `newdata`.  

```{r}

posterior_predict(fit_1, 
                  newdata = tibble(constant = rep(1, 20))) %>% 
  as_tibble()
```

Each of our 4,000 rows represent one instance of us predicting a future sample from the urn, and each column represents the color bead in a shovel slot. We will create a new column called `total` and use `rowSums()` to calculate the total number of red beads drawn in the sample. Finally, we will graph the resulting distribution.  

```{r}
ppd_reds_in_20 <- posterior_predict(fit_1, 
                  newdata = tibble(constant = rep(1, 20))) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(total = rowSums(across(`1`:`20`))) %>% 
  select(total)


ppd_reds_in_20   %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = total)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),
                   bins = 50) +
    labs(title = "Posterior Probability Distribution",
         subtitle = "Number of red beads in 20-slot shovel",
         x = "Number of Red Beads",
         y = "Probability") +  
    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(accuracy = 1)) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
    theme_classic()
```

We have successfully created the posterior probability distribution for the number of red beads drawn in a shovel of size 20. But before we answer our question, some of us may be wondering why we made our predictions using `posterior_predict()` instead of `posterior_epred()`. Let's examine what happens if we use `posterior_epred()` instead.

```{r, fig.cap = "Using posterior_epred()"}

post_epred <- posterior_epred(fit_1, 
                  newdata = tibble(constant = rep(1, 20))) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(total = rowSums(across(`1`:`20`))) %>% 
  select(total)

post_epred  %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = total)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),
                   bins = 50) +
    labs(title = "Posterior probability distribution using posterior_epred()",
         subtitle = "In our scenario, using posterior_epred() is incorrect",
         x = "Number of red beads",
         y = "Probability") + 
    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(accuracy = 1)) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
    theme_classic()
```


What happened? `posterior_epred()` shows the distribution of the **entire population**, which is continuous. The expected predictions can be fractional, because `posterior_epred()` returns draws from the posterior (which can be fractional) contingent on some covariate. In our scenario we have no covariates for which to create expected predictions from, so `posterior_epred()` just returns the posterior, but re-scaled to between 0 and 20 beads instead of between 0 and 1 as before. The shape of the distributions are identical: 

```{r}
post_epred %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = total)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),
                   bins = 50) + 
  labs(x = "Number of red beads sampled out of 20",
       y = "Probability") + 
  ppd_for_p  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = p)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),
                   bins = 50) +
  labs(x = "Proportion red in urn",
       y = "Probability") + 
  plot_annotation(title = 'Expected prediction for sample of size 20 on left, posterior on right.',
                  subtitle = "The two distributions have an identical shape.")
```

On the other hand, `posterior_predict()` models the posterior distribution for future **individuals**. In our scenario, we model the binomial distribution of a discrete random variable. The bars only appear at real numbers between 1 and 16, because we are predicting the probability of individual samples. We cannot draw fractions of beads in our sample. Using `posterior_predict()` essentially replicates the DGM, taking many virtual draws from our urn and summarizing all the results. 

In summary, use `posterior_predict()` when to predict the outcome of individual(s) in the future, and use `posterior_epred()` to model the probability across the entire population using the posterior. To answer our question, we want to know the probability of outcomes using a single shovel of size 20. We should use `posterior_predict()` to model taking individual samples many times, and we can then analyze the probabilities. If this is confusing do not fret! We will have plenty of practice with these 2 functions for the remainder of this *Primer*. 

Now let's attempt to actually answer our question: 

>What is the probability, using the same urn, that we will draw more than 8 red beads if we use a shovel of size 20?

Because `posterior_predict()` takes predictive draws for us, we can simply count the number of draws that have more than 8 red beads, and divide by the total number of draws. 

```{r}
# Same code as earlier, included as a refresher. 
ppd_reds_in_20 <- posterior_predict(fit_1, 
                  newdata = tibble(constant = rep(1, 20))) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(total = rowSums(across(`1`:`20`))) %>% 
  select(total)

# Calculating the probability
sum(ppd_reds_in_20$total > 8)/length(ppd_reds_in_20$total)
```

**There is approximately a `r round(100 *sum(ppd_reds_in_20$total > 8)/length(ppd_reds_in_20$total))`% chance that we will draw more than 8 red beads out of a sample size of 20.**

To visualize this probability graphically, we will reuse our posterior, and add a new column called `above_eight` that is `TRUE` if `total > 8`. 

```{r}

ppd_reds_in_20 <- posterior_predict(fit_1, 
                    newdata = tibble(constant = rep(1, 20))) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(total = rowSums(across(`1`:`20`))) %>%
  select(total) %>%
  mutate(above_eight = ifelse(total > 8, TRUE, FALSE))

ppd_reds_in_20
```

We can then can set the fill of our histogram to when `above_eight == TRUE` to visualize the probability of drawing more than 8 red beads. 

```{r}
ppd_reds_in_20   %>% 
  
  # Set fill as above_eight. 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = total, fill = above_eight)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),
                   bins = 50) +
  
  # Scale_fill_manual()  is calling grey for the first color and red for the
  # second color. This is going to highlight the portion of the curve that we
  # want to highlight in red.

  scale_fill_manual(values = c('grey50', 'red')) +
    labs(title = "Posterior Probability Distribution",
         subtitle = "Number of red beads in 20-slot shovel",
         x = "Number of Red Beads",
         y = "Probability",
         fill = "More than 8 Red Beads Drawn?") +  
    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(accuracy = 1)) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
    theme_classic()
```

The red bars illustrate the area under a specific section of the curve, as compared to the *entire* area under the curve. *Each question requires looking at a new area under the curve.* When someones asks you a question, they are doing two things. First, they are providing instructions as to the posterior your should create. Here, the results with a shovel of 20 slots. Second, they are asking a question about the area under the curve in a specific region. Here, the region where the number of red beads is greater than 8 is highlighted in red. Therefore, the area below the curve that **is red** is how we get our estimate. 

See Chapter \@ref(two-parameters) for a thorough discussion of the use of **rstanarm**. This package will be our main tool for the rest of the *Primer*.

#### Assesing uncertainty

<!-- RS: This kind of acts as a short summary + going over limitations of Temperance.  -->

The process Cardinal Virtues process may seem tedious, but we use them for good reason. In Wisdom we determined what data we need to answer our question, and in Justice we analyzed whether or not the data we have can answer our question. If we had skipped these steps, we would be at risk of creating models with "bad data" in Courage and Temperance, and draw misleading conclusions. 

We have successfully answered our questions using the Cardinal Virtues, but we must also realize that there are limitations to our models. Earlier we claimed there is a `r round(100 *sum(ppd_reds_in_20$total > 8)/length(ppd_reds_in_20$total))`% chance that we will draw more than 8 red beads out of a sample size of 20. However, we must be modest about our claims. Is this question about *this* particular urn, or all urns? Clearly, as our predictions are based upon the posterior from our specific urn, our conclusions can only be applied to *this particular urn*; our conclusions are not generalizable to all urns.

Furthermore, how certain are we in our prediction from Temperance that `r round(100 *sum(ppd_reds_in_20$total > 8)/length(ppd_reds_in_20$total))`% of samples out of a shovel size of 20 using our urn would produce more than 8 red beads? 

First let's model our situation: 

$$ T_i  \sim B(\rho, n = 20) $$

The total number of red beads selected in a sample of 20 beads, $T_i$, is modeled by a binomial distribution with $n = 20$ observations and an unknown probability $\rho$ of the proportion of red beads in the urn.

We must realize that our `r round(100 *sum(ppd_reds_in_20$total > 8)/length(ppd_reds_in_20$total))`% estimate is based on an entire posterior. We are uncertain about the exact value of $\rho$, so `posterior_predict()` takes our uncertainty into account when creating the model. However, there is in fact some actual value for $\rho$, even if we don't know it. 

If the actual value of $\rho$ was 30%, we can calculate the **correct** answer to our question using the binomial probability distribution function:  

```{r}
pbinom(q = 8, size = 20, prob = .3, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

Or maybe the actual value of $\rho$ is 40%: 

```{r}
pbinom(q = 8, size = 20, prob = .4, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

Sadly, the answer to our question could be `r round(pbinom(q = 8, size = 20, prob = .3, lower.tail = FALSE)*100)`%, `r round(pbinom(q = 8, size = 20, prob = .4, lower.tail = FALSE)*100)`%, a value in between, or even a more extreme value. We will never know the correct answer, and must settle with our best estimate of `r round(100 *sum(ppd_reds_in_20$total > 8)/length(ppd_reds_in_20$total))`% that factors in our uncertainty regarding the true value of $\rho$. Long story short, our models are never the truth. 

<!-- RS: Nicely worded but I'm not sure if it fits in. Maybe a future author will find use for it.  -->

<!-- Asserting a posterior distribution is, conceptually, the same as opening a casino and allowing people to place wagers on outcomes, with the odds consistent with your posterior. If your posterior is wrong, they will take all your money. That would be bad! So, what do we do? Rule of thumb: the future is always more variable than our models would suggest. The entire point of the virtue of Temperance to be aware of that fact and take account of it. Courage --- that bold bastard --- comes along and says, "Here is the model! Let's calculate the posterior and open the casino!" Temperance says, "Hold on! Yes, I can calculate the posterior, but we need to be cautious." Temperance is concerned with the tails of our predictions, not the center. What is the best strategy for opening our casino, then? Limit the bets on the first few nights to make sure our posterior is OK. *Temperance is concerned with the sensible management of the casino.* -->

### Bad practices

Although the process was long, we have successfully gone through the cardinal virtues and answered our questions like real data scientists. In this section we will address some pitfalls to avoid. 

#### Confidence intervals

<!-- RS: If we end up not discussing the √p(1-p)/n equation, then this section will have to be deleted or reworked.  -->

Let's go back to our first question:

>If we get 17 red beads in a random sample of size 50 taken from a mixed urn, what proportion $\rho$ of the beads in the urn are red?

If we had decided to, we could have answered this question using confidence intervals and statistics. First calculate the standard error given 34% of the beads in the sample are red out of a sample size of 50:

$$  SE = \sqrt\frac{.34(1-.34)}{50} \approx .067$$

We can then create a 95% confidence interval:

$$  CI = \bar{x} \hspace{.1cm} \pm 2SE = .34 \hspace{.1cm} \pm .134$$

With 95% confidence, the proportion of red beads in the urn is between 21% and 47%. 

This is correct, but quite difficult to conceptualize. If our boss needs a quick answer, by all means we can use a confidence interval to save us from doing all the work we did earlier! However, **we must be careful with confidence intervals.** If we had chosen to answer the first question using them, we would be unable to answer any questions in Temperance. The confidence interval gives us a general range of our uncertainty, but to answer a question that requires knowledge about the value of a parameter, the confidence interval does us very little good. As data scientists we create the posterior distribution to quantify our uncertainty and answer all our questions. 

#### Hypothesis tests

Statisticians, like how they use confidence intervals, also use hypothesis tests to quickly **try** to answer questions. Recall our view on hypothesis tests: **Amateurs test. Professionals summarize.** Traditionally, most scientific papers are not so much interested in estimating $\rho$. They are interested in testing specific hypotheses. What do we mean by that?

Let's look at a possible hypothesis in our urn paradigm: there are equal number of red and white beads in the urn. The null hypothesis, denoted by $H_0$, is the theory we are testing, while the alternative hypothesis, denoted by $H_a$, represents the opposite of our theory. Therefore, our hypothesis is designed as such:

$H_0$: There are an equal number of red and white beads in the urn.

$H_a$: There are *not* an equal number of red and white beads in the urn. 

Can we reject that hypothesis? Convention: if the 95% confidence interval excludes the null hypothesis, then we reject it. Here, that would mean if our posterior estimate (plus or minus 2 standard errors) *excluded* the possibility of the red and white beads being equal ($\rho = .5$) we can reject the null hypothesis. In the previous section we determined that the 95% confidence interval is between 21% and 47%. Because 50% is outside of this interval, we could reject the null hypothesis, and conclude that it is unlikely that the proportion of beads in the urn is 50%. 

If we were testing the theory that $\rho = .45$ instead, our null hypothesis would fall within the confidence interval. This does not mean that we accept the null hypothesis, we just don't reject it.  When we can’t reject the null hypothesis our test is essentially useless, as we have no idea whether or not our theory is true. In our scenario we only know that there is some possibility that $\rho = .45$. We're just back where we started! This is why we never test — unless your boss demands a test. **Use your judgment, make your models, summarize your knowledge of the world, and use that summary to make decisions.** 

## Case study: Polls {#sampling-case-study}

Let's now switch gears to a more realistic sampling scenario: a poll. In practice, pollsters do not take 1,000 repeated samples as we did in our previous sampling activities, but rather take only a *single sample* that's as large as possible.

On December 4, 2013, National Public Radio in the US reported on a poll of President Obama's approval rating among young Americans aged 18-29 in an article, ["Poll: Support For Obama Among Young Americans Eroding."](https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2013/12/04/248793753/poll-support-for-obama-among-young-americans-eroding) The poll was conducted by the Kennedy School's Institute of Politics at Harvard University. A quote from the article:

> After voting for him in large numbers in 2008 and 2012, young Americans are souring on President Obama.
> 
> According to a new Harvard University Institute of Politics poll, just 41 percent of millennials — adults ages 18-29 — approve of Obama's job performance, his lowest-ever standing among the group and an 11-point drop from April.

Let's tie elements of the real life poll in this new article with our "tactile" and "virtual" urn activity from Sections \@ref(sampling-activity) and \@ref(virtual-sampling) using the terminology, notations, and definitions we learned in Section \@ref(standard-errors). You'll see that our sampling activity with the urn is an idealized version of what pollsters are trying to do in real life. 

First, who is the **(Study) Population** of $N$ individuals or observations of interest? 

* Urn: $N$ = 1000 identically sized red and white beads
* Obama poll: $N$ = ? young Americans aged 18-29

Second, what is the **population parameter**? 

* Urn: The population proportion $\rho$ of *all* the beads in the urn that are red.
* Obama poll: The population proportion $\rho$ of *all* young Americans who approve of Obama's job performance.

Third, what would a **census** look like?

* Urn: Manually going over all $N$ = 1000 beads and exactly computing the population proportion $\rho$ of the beads that are red.
* Obama poll: Locating all $N$ young Americans and asking them all if they approve of Obama's job performance. In this case, we don't even know what the population size $N$ is!

Fourth, how do you perform **sampling** to obtain a sample of size $n$?

* Urn: Using a shovel with $n$ slots. 
* Obama poll: One method is to get a list of phone numbers of all young Americans and pick out $n$ phone numbers. In this poll's case, the sample size of this poll was $n = 2089$ young Americans.

Fifth, what is your **point estimate (AKA sample statistic)** of the unknown population parameter?

* Urn: The sample proportion $\hat{\rho}$ of the beads in the shovel that were red. 
* Obama poll: The sample proportion $\hat{\rho}$ of young Americans in the sample that approve of Obama's job performance. In this poll's case, $\hat{\rho} = 0.41 = 41\%$, the quoted percentage in the second paragraph of the article. 

Sixth, is the sampling procedure **representative**?

* Urn: Are the contents of the shovel representative of the contents of the urn? Because we mixed the urn before sampling, we can feel confident that they are. 
* Obama poll: Is the sample of $n = 2089$ young Americans representative of *all* young Americans aged 18-29? This depends on whether the sampling was random.

<!-- RS: Also describe the differences between the real urn and the virtual urn, and that the virtual urn is much simpler than real life because the samples are truly random. -->

Seventh, are the samples **generalizable** to the greater population?

* Urn: Is the sample proportion $\hat{\rho}$ of the shovel's beads that are red a "good guess" of the population proportion $\rho$ of the urn's beads that are red? Given that the sample was representative, the answer is yes.
* Obama poll: Is the sample proportion $\hat{\rho} = 0.41$ of the sample of young Americans who supported Obama a "good guess" of the population proportion $\rho$ of all young Americans who supported Obama at this time in 2013? In other words, can we confidently say that roughly 41% of *all* young Americans approved of Obama at the time of the poll? Again, this depends on whether the sampling was random.

Eighth, is the sampling procedure **unbiased**? In other words, do all observations have an equal chance of being included in the sample?

* Urn: Since each bead was equally sized and we mixed the urn before using the shovel, each bead had an equal chance of being included in a sample and hence the sampling was unbiased. 
* Obama poll: Did all young Americans have an equal chance at being represented in this poll? Again, this depends on whether the sampling was random.

Ninth and lastly, was the sampling done at **random**? 

* Urn: As long as you mixed the urn sufficiently before sampling, your samples would be random.
* Obama poll: Was the sample conducted at random? We can't answer this question without knowing about the *sampling methodology* used by Kennedy School's Institute of Politics at Harvard University. We'll discuss this more at the end of this section.

In other words, the poll by Kennedy School's Institute of Politics at Harvard University can be thought of as *an instance* of using the shovel to sample beads from the urn. Furthermore, if another polling company conducted a similar poll of young Americans at roughly the same time, they would likely get a different estimate than 41%. This is due to *sampling variation*.

Let's now revisit the sampling paradigm from Subsection \@ref(terminology-and-notation):

**In general**: 

* If the sampling of a sample of size $n$ is done at **random**, then
* the sample is **unbiased** and **representative** of the population of size $N$, thus
* any result based on the sample can **generalize** to the population, thus
* the point estimate is a **"good guess"** of the unknown population parameter, thus
* instead of performing a census, we can **infer** about the population using sampling.

**Specific to the urn:**

* If we extract a sample of $n = 50$ beads at **random**, in other words, we mix all of the equally sized beads before using the shovel, then
* the contents of the shovel are an **unbiased representation** of the contents of the urn's 1000 beads, thus
* any result based on the shovel's beads can **generalize** to the urn, thus
* the sample proportion $\hat{\rho}$ of the $n = 50$ beads in the shovel that are red is a **"good guess"** of the population proportion $\rho$ of the $N = 1000$ beads that are red, thus
* instead of manually going over all 1000 beads in the urn, we can **infer** about the urn using the shovel. 

**Specific to the Obama poll:**

* If we had a way of contacting a **randomly** chosen sample of 2089 young Americans and polling their approval of President Obama in 2013, then
* these 2089 young Americans would be an **unbiased** and **representative** sample of *all* young Americans in 2013, thus 
* any results based on this sample of 2089 young Americans can **generalize** to the entire population of *all* young Americans in 2013, thus
* the reported sample approval rating of 41% of these 2089 young Americans is a **good guess** of the true approval rating among all young Americans in 2013, thus
* instead of performing an expensive census of all young Americans in 2013, we can **infer** about all young Americans in 2013 using polling.

So as you can see, it was critical for the sample obtained by Kennedy School's Institute of Politics at Harvard University to be truly random in order to infer about *all* young Americans' opinions about Obama. Was their sample truly random? It's hard to answer such questions without knowing about the *sampling methodology* they used. 

For example, what if Kennedy School's Institute of Politics at Harvard University conducted this poll using only mobile phone numbers? People without mobile phones would be left out and therefore not represented in the sample. This flaw is an example of **censoring**, the exclusion of certain datapoints due to an issue with data collection. This results in an incomplete observation and increases the prediction uncertainty of the estimand, Obama's approval rating among young Americans. Ensuring that our samples were random was easy to do in our sampling urn exercises; however, in a real life situation like the Obama poll, this is much harder to do.

What you have visualized in this chapter was a demonstration of a famous theorem, or mathematically proven truth, called the *Central Limit Theorem*. It loosely states that when sample means are based on larger and larger sample sizes, the sampling distribution of these sample means becomes both more and more normally shaped and more and more narrow. In other words, the sampling distribution increasingly follows a *normal distribution* and the variation of these sampling distributions gets smaller, as quantified by their standard errors.


<!-- RS: Add back discussion on sampling mechanisms but w/ Obama census.  -->

<!-- RS: I definetly support further exploring the Kennedy study further in this chapter, or in the tutorial because I feel like it would be much more informative than redoing the urn problem.  -->

<!-- RS: Consider a brief section about observational study design? I know this isn't a stats class, but might be useful to at least discuss bad sampling methods (volunteer surveys, convienence, and other types of biases. ) -->



## Summary

Key lesson:

There is a truth! There is a true value for $\rho$ which we do not know! We want to create a posterior probability distribution which summarizes our knowledge. We care about the posterior probability distribution of p. The center of that distribution is around the mean or median of the proportion in your sample. The sd (or mad) of that posterior is the standard deviation divided by the square root of our sample size! Note that this is the same thing as the standard deviation of the repeated samples.

Key lesson: 

We have a journey from reality, to our predictions, to the standard error of our predictions, to the posterior probability distribution for p. This is our sequence:

**p (the truth) $\Rightarrow$ $\hat{\rho}$ (my estimate) $\Rightarrow$ the standard error of $\hat{\rho}$ (black box of math mumbo jumbo and computer simulation magic) $\Rightarrow$ our posterior probability distribution for p (our beliefs about the truth).**

This journey shows how our beliefs about the truth develop through our work. We begin with p; p is the truth, the true but unknown value we are estimating. $\hat{\rho}$ is our estimate for p. There can be millions and millions of $\hat{\rho}$'s. Next, we must take the standard error of our estimates (our $\hat{\rho}$'s) to account for our uncertainty with our predictions. Finally -- the thing we need most -- we create a posterior probability distribution for p. This distribution is used to answer key questions about p. 



Other highlights:

### Tactial sampling

- Sampling allows us to make guesses at an unknown, difficult-to-obtain value by looking at a smaller subset of data and generalizing it to the larger population. 
- Sampling is preferable in the urn example because counting out 1000 beads from an urn is intensive and tedious. 
- Sampling is preferable in the real-world because it is often impossible to sample "all the beads" (all the people) in a population. With sampling, you see variations in your results. This is known as sampling variation and is expected, especially if you draw samples at random (unbiased).

### Virtual sampling

- By creating a virtual analog of our urn and our shovel, we were able to look at *even more* samples and observe the effects of sampling size on our results. 
- More samples yield more even distributions which should resemble a bell. 
- Larger sample sizes decrease standard deviation, meaning that the resulting proportions red are closer to one another than when the sample sizes are smaller. This means that larger samples = lower SD = more precise guesses. 
- When we are writing a lot of code for something we want to perform frequently, write a function instead! This saves time and functions can be called within `map()` for more ease when plotting results.

### Standard error

- Standard error is just a fancy term for your uncertainty about something you don't know. Standard error $\approx$ our (uncertain) beliefs. 
- The standard error measures the accuracy of a sample distribution as compared to the population by using the standard deviation. 
- We find that larger sample sizes $\implies$ lower standard errors $\implies$ more accurate estimates.   
- If we could only know two pieces of information from our data, we would need a measure of the **center** of the distribution (like mean or median) and a measure of the **variability** of the distribution (like sd or MAD). 
- SE refers to the standard deviation of a sample statistic (aka point estimate), such as the mean or median. Therefore, the "standard error of the mean" refers to the standard deviation of the distribution of sample means taken from a population. 

### Answering the questions

- `stan_glm()` can create a joint distribution and then estimate the posterior probability distribution, conditional on the data which was passed in to the data argument. This is a much easier way to create the posterior distribution, and will be explored in more detail in Chapter \@ref(two-parameters). 

### Discussion

- The sampling mechanism is responsible for which items/beads/people/etc are selected to be sampled. In the urn example, the *sampling mechanism* is the shovel. 
- Random sampling ensures that our point estimates are **accurate**, while having a large sample size ensures that our estimates are **precise**. The difference between precision and accuracy is important if we are to make informed estimates. 
- Real life sampling is *extremely* prone to error. This cannot be emphasized enough. We are often forced to choose between precision and accuracy during real-life sampling. 

In this chapter, we performed both tactile and virtual sampling exercises to infer about an unknown parameter We also presented a case study of sampling in real life with polls. In each case, we used the sample proportion $\hat{\rho}$ to estimate the population proportion $\rho$. However, we are not just limited to scenarios related to proportions. In other words, we can use sampling to estimate other population parameters using other point estimates as well.

As we continue our journey, recall the case of Primrose Everdeen and what she represents: no matter how realistic is our model is, our predictions are **never certain**.
