# Welcome {.unnumbered}

<!-- nocite: '@*' is what ensures that all the references appear. Not sure why! -->

<!-- Need a new cover. Sirens will do for now. Format more like Mastering Shiny?-->

This isn't the book you're looking for.

```

First, the book is for students in [Gov 1005: Big Data](https://www.davidkane.info/files/gov_1005_spring_2021.html), a course offered in the Government Department at Harvard University. Everything about the book is designed to make the experience of those students better. Some of the material here may be useful to people outside of this class, but I don't really care if it is.

Second, the book changes all the time. It is as up-to-date as possible.

Third, I am highly opinionated about what matters and what does not. It is unlikely that you share my views.
