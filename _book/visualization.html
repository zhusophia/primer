<p>People love visualizations. This chapter focuses on <strong>ggplot2</strong>, one of the core packages in the <strong>tidyverse</strong>. To access the datasets, help pages, and functions that we will use in this chapter, load the tidyverse by running this code:</p>

<p>That one line of code loads all the packages associated with the <strong>tidyverse</strong>, packages which you will use in almost every data analysis. It also tells you which functions from the tidyverse conflict with functions in base R or with other packages you might have loaded. (In the future, we will hide these and other messages because they are ugly.)</p>
<p>If you run this code and get the error message “there is no package called ‘tidyverse’”, you’ll need to first install it, then run library() once again.</p>

<p>Recall, we only need to install a package once. We need to load it every time we use it. We will also use two other packages in this chapter: <strong>gapminder</strong> and <strong>nycflights13</strong>.</p>
<!-- DK: Do we really need both of these? Why not just use PPBDS.data, so that we start looking at politics quickly? -->

<p>These packages contain datasets which we will use when creating visualizations. You may need to install these packages if you have not already done so.</p>
<p>If we need to be explicit about where a function (or dataset) comes from, we’ll use the special form: <code>package::function()</code>. For example, <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.html">ggplot2::ggplot()</a></code> tells you explicitly that we’re using the <code>ggplot()</code> function from the <strong>ggplot2</strong> package.</p>
<!-- DK: Can't we make a better graphic to get people excited? How many students even know what an iris is? -->
<p>Now that you’re all set up, let’s create our first data visualization in R using the <code>iris</code> dataset! This famous iris data set gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length and width and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris (setosa, versicolor, and virginica). You can learn more about the dataset by running <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/datasets/iris.html">?iris</a></code> to access the help page.</p>

<p>Wow! Just by running a few lines of code you created a nice visualization to compare the measured petal lengths for each of the 3 species of iris! You’ll learn more about what these lines of code mean and how to write others like them throughout the chapter, but for now, let’s learn more about coding in R.</p>

<p>Unlike other statistical software programs like Excel, SPSS, or Minitab that provide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_and_click">point-and-click</a> interfaces, R is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language">interpreted language</a>. This means you have to type in commands written in <em>R code</em>. In other words, you have to code/program in R. Note that we’ll use the terms “coding” and “programming” interchangeably in this book.</p>
<p>If you are new to the world of coding, R, and RStudio and feel you could benefit from a more detailed introduction, we suggest you check out the short book, <a href="https://rbasics.netlify.com/"><em>Getting Used to R, RStudio, and R Markdown</em></a>. <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="usedtor2016"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> includes screencast recordings that you can follow along and pause as you learn. This book also contains an introduction to R Markdown, a tool used for reproducible research in R.</p>
<p>While it is not required to be a seasoned coder/computer programmer to use R, there is still a set of basic programming concepts that new R users need to understand.</p>

<p>Learning to code/program is quite similar to learning a foreign language. It can be daunting and frustrating at first. Such frustrations are common and it is normal to feel disCouraged as you learn. However, just as with learning a foreign language, if you put in the effort and are not afraid to make mistakes, anybody can learn and improve.</p>
<p>Here are a few useful tips to keep in mind as you learn to program:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Remember that computers are not actually that smart</strong>: You may think your computer or smartphone is “smart,” but really people spent a lot of time and energy designing them to appear “smart.” In reality, you have to tell a computer everything it needs to do. Furthermore, the instructions you give your computer can’t have any mistakes in them, nor can they be ambiguous in any way.</li>
<li>
<strong>Take the “copy, paste, and tweak” approach</strong>: Especially when you learn your first programming language or you need to understand particularly complicated code, it is often much easier to take existing code that you know works and modify it to suit your ends. This is as opposed to trying to type out the code from scratch. We call this the <em>“copy, paste, and tweak”</em> approach. So early on, we suggest not trying to write code from memory, but rather take existing examples we have provided you, then copy, paste, and tweak them to suit your goals. After you start feeling more confident, you can slowly move away from this approach and write code from scratch. Think of the “copy, paste, and tweak” approach as training wheels for learning to ride a bike. After getting comfortable, you won’t need them anymore.</li>
<li>
<strong>The best way to learn to code is by doing</strong>: Rather than learning to code for its own sake, we find that learning to code goes much smoother when you have a goal in mind or when you are working on a particular project, like analyzing data that you are interested in and that is important to you.</li>
<li>
<strong>Practice is key</strong>: Just as the only method to improve your foreign language skills is through lots of practice and speaking, the only method to improving your coding skills is through lots of practice. Write R code every day.</li>
</ul>

<p>We now introduce some basic programming concepts and terminology. Instead of asking you to memorize all these concepts and terminology right now, we’ll guide you so that you’ll “learn by doing.” To help you learn, we will always use a different font to distinguish regular text from <code>computer_code</code>. The best way to master these topics is, in our opinions, through <a href="https://jamesclear.com/deliberate-practice-theory">deliberate practice</a> with R and lots of repetition.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Console pane</em>: where you enter in commands.</li>
<li>
<em>Running code</em>: the act of telling R to perform an act by giving it commands in the console.</li>
<li>
<em>Objects</em>: where values are saved in R. We’ll show you how to <em>assign</em> values to objects and how to display the contents of objects.</li>
<li>
<em>Data types</em>: integers, doubles/numerics, logicals, and characters. Integers are values like -1, 0, 2, 4092. Doubles or numerics are a larger set of values containing both the integers but also fractions and decimal values like -24.932 and 0.8. Logicals are either <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code> while characters are text such as “cabbage”, “Hamilton”, “The Wire is the greatest TV show ever”, and “This ramen is delicious.” Note that characters are often denoted with the quotation marks around them.</li>
<li>
<em>Vectors</em>: a series of values. These are created using the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html">c()</a></code> function, where <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html">c()</a></code> stands for “combine” or “concatenate.” For example, <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html">c(6, 11, 13, 31, 90, 92)</a></code> creates a six element series of positive integer values.</li>
<li>
<em>Factors</em>: <em>categorical data</em> are commonly represented in R as factors. Categorical data can also be represented as <em>strings</em>. We will go into detail about these and other variable types in Chapter 2.</li>
<li>
<em>Data frames</em>: rectangular spreadsheets. They are representations of datasets in R where the rows correspond to <em>observations</em> and the columns correspond to <em>variables</em> that describe the observations. Modern data frames are called <em>tibbles</em>.<br>
</li>
<li>
<em>Boolean algebra</em>: <code>TRUE/FALSE</code> statements and mathematical operators such as <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Comparison.html">&lt;</a></code> (less than), <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Comparison.html">&lt;=</a></code> (less than or equal), and <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Comparison.html">!=</a></code> (not equal to). For example, <code>4 + 2 &gt;= 3</code> will return <code>TRUE</code>, but <code>3 + 5 &lt;= 1</code> will return <code>FALSE</code>. Testing for inclusion with the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/match.html">%in%</a></code> operator. For example, <code>"B" %in% c("A", "B")</code> returns <code>TRUE</code> while <code>"C" %in% c("A", "B")</code> returns <code>FALSE</code>. We test for equality in R using <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Comparison.html">==</a></code> (and not <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/assignOps.html">=</a></code>, which is typically used for assignment). For example, <code>2 + 1 == 3</code> compares <code>2 + 1</code> to <code>3</code> and is correct R code, while <code>2 + 1 = 3</code> will return an error.</li>
<li>
<em>Logical operators</em>: <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Logic.html">&amp;</a></code> representing “and” as well as <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Logic.html">|</a></code> representing “or.” For example, <code>(2 + 1 == 3) &amp; (2 + 1 == 4)</code> returns <code>FALSE</code> since both clauses are not <code>TRUE</code> (only the first clause is <code>TRUE</code>). On the other hand, <code>(2 + 1 == 3) | (2 + 1 == 4)</code> returns <code>TRUE</code> since at least one of the two clauses is <code>TRUE</code>.</li>
<li>
<em>Functions</em>, also called <em>commands</em>: perform tasks in R. They take in inputs called <em>arguments</em> and return outputs. You can either manually specify a function’s arguments or use the function’s <em>default values</em>. For example, the function <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/seq.html">seq()</a></code> in R generates a sequence of numbers. If you just run <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/seq.html">seq()</a></code> it will return the value 1. That doesn’t seem very useful! This is because the default arguments are set as <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/seq.html">seq(from = 1, to = 1)</a></code>. Thus, if you don’t pass in different values for <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> to change this behavior, R just assumes all you want is the number 1. You can change the argument values by updating the values after the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/assignOps.html">=</a></code> sign. If we try out <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/seq.html">seq(from = 2, to = 5)</a></code> we get the result <code>2 3 4 5</code>, as we would expect.</li>
<li>
<em>Help files</em>: provide documentation for various functions and datasets. You can bring up help files by adding a <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/Question.html">?</a></code> before the name of a function or data frame and then run this in the console. You will then be presented with a page showing the corresponding documentation.</li>
</ul>

<div id="errors-warnings-and-messages" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.1.4</span> Errors, warnings, and messages<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#errors-warnings-and-messages"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>R reports errors, warnings, and messages in a glaring red font, which makes it seem like it is scolding you. However, seeing red text in the console is not always bad.</p>
<p>R will show red text in the console pane in three different situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Errors</strong>: When the red text is a legitimate error, it will be prefaced with “Error in…” and will try to explain what went wrong. Generally when there’s an error, the code will not run. For example, if you see <code>Error in ggplot(...) : could not find function "ggplot"</code>, it means that the <code>ggplot()</code> function is not accessible because the package that contains the function, <strong>ggplot2</strong>, was not loaded with <code><a href="http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org">library(ggplot2)</a></code>. You cannot use the <code>ggplot()</code> function without the <strong>ggplot2</strong> package being loaded first.</li>
<li>
<strong>Warnings</strong>: When the red text is a warning, it will be prefaced with “Warning:” and R will try to explain why there’s a warning. Generally your code will still work, but with some caveats. If you create a scatterplot based on a dataset where two of the rows of data have missing entries, you will see this warning: <code>Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point)</code>. R will still produce the scatterplot with all the remaining non-missing values, but it is warning you that two of the points aren’t there.</li>
<li>
<strong>Messages</strong>: When the red text doesn’t start with either “Error” or “Warning”, it’s <em>just a friendly message</em>. You’ll see these messages when you load <em>R packages</em> or when you read data saved in spreadsheet files with the <code>read_csv()</code> function as you’ll see in Chapter 2. These are helpful diagnostic messages. They don’t stop your code from working. Additionally, you’ll see these messages when you install packages too using <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/install.packages.html">install.packages()</a></code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, when you see red text in the console, <em>don’t panic</em>. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong. Rather:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the text starts with “Error”, figure out what’s causing it. <span style="color:red">Think of errors as a red traffic light: something is wrong!</span>
</li>
<li>If the text starts with “Warning”, figure out if it’s something to worry about. For instance, if you get a warning about missing values in a scatterplot and you know there are missing values, you’re fine. If that’s surprising, look at your data and see what’s missing. <span style="color:gold">Think of warnings as a yellow traffic light: everything is working fine, but watch out/pay attention.</span>
</li>
<li>Otherwise, the text is just a message. Read it, wave back at R, and thank it for talking to you. <span style="color:green">Think of messages as a green traffic light: everything is working fine and keep on going!</span>
</li>
</ul>

</h3>
<p>Let’s put everything we’ve learned so far into practice and start exploring some real data! Data comes to us in a variety of formats, from pictures to text to numbers. Throughout this book, we’ll focus on datasets that are saved in “spreadsheet”-type format. This is probably the most common way data are collected and saved in many fields. These “spreadsheet”-type datasets are called <em>data frames</em> in R. We’ll focus on working with data saved as data frames throughout this book. Again, “tibble” is the more modern term for “data frame,” but we will use both interchangeably.</p>
<pre class="marginfigure"><code>See ["Causal effect of intergroup contact on attitudes," by Ryan D. Enos, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Mar 2014, 111 (10)](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/renos/files/enostrains.pdf) for background and details on the `trains` dataset.</code></pre>
<p>We’ll begin by exploring the <code>trains</code> data frame in the <code>PPBDS.data</code> package and get an idea of its structure. This dataset includes data for attitudes toward immigration-related policies, both before and after an experiment which randomly exposed commuters to Spanish-speakers on a Boston train platform. Individuals with a treatment value of “Treated” were exposed to two Spanish-speakers on their regular commute. “Control” individuals were not.</p>
<p>Run the following code in your console, either by typing it or by cutting-and-pasting it. It displays the contents of the <code>trains</code> data frame in your console. Note that depending on the size of your monitor, the output may vary slightly.</p>

<li>
<code>A tibble: 115 x 8</code>: A <code>tibble</code> is a specific kind of data frame in R. This particular data frame has <code>115</code> rows corresponding to different <em>observations</em>.

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.1.6</span> Exploring data frames<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#exploring-data-frames"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>There are many ways to get a feel for the data contained in a data frame such as <code>trains</code>. We present two functions that take as their “argument” (their input) the data frame in question. We also include a third method for exploring one particular column of a data frame:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Using the <code><a href="https://gganimate.com/reference/gganimate-ggproto.html">View()</a></code> function, which brings up RStudio’s built-in data viewer.</li>
<li>Using the <code>glimpse()</code> function, which is included in the <strong>dplyr</strong> package.</li>
<li>Using the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Extract.html">$</a></code> “extraction operator,” which is used to view a single variable/column in a data frame.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>1. <code><a href="https://gganimate.com/reference/gganimate-ggproto.html">View()</a></code></strong>:</p>
<p>Run <code><a href="https://gganimate.com/reference/gganimate-ggproto.html">View(trains)</a></code> in your console in RStudio, either by typing it or cutting-and-pasting it into the console pane. Explore this data frame in the resulting pop up viewer. You should get into the habit of viewing any data frames you encounter. Note the uppercase <code>V</code> in <code><a href="https://gganimate.com/reference/gganimate-ggproto.html">View()</a></code>. R is case-sensitive, so you’ll get an error message if you run <code>view(trains)</code> instead of <code><a href="https://gganimate.com/reference/gganimate-ggproto.html">View(trains)</a></code>.</p>
<p>By running <code><a href="https://gganimate.com/reference/gganimate-ggproto.html">View(trains)</a></code>, we can explore the different <em>variables</em> listed in the columns. Observe that there are many different types of variables. Some of the variables including <code>age</code>, <code>income</code>, <code>att_start</code>, and <code>att_end</code> are <em>quantitative</em> variables. These variables are numerical in nature. Other variables here, including <code>gender</code>, <code>liberal</code>, <code>party</code>, and <code>treatment</code>, are <em>categorical</em>.</p>
<p>Note that if you look in the leftmost column of the <code><a href="https://gganimate.com/reference/gganimate-ggproto.html">View(trains)</a></code> output, you will see a column of numbers. These are the row numbers of the dataset. If you glance across a row with the same number, say row 5, you can get an idea of what each row is representing. This will allow you to identify what object is being described in a given row by taking note of the values of the columns in that specific row. This is often called the <em>observational unit</em>. The observational unit in this example is an individual participating in the experiment on the Boston commuter train platform.</p>
<p>You can identify the observational unit by determining what “thing” is being measured or described by each of the variables.</p>
<p><strong>2. <code>glimpse()</code></strong>:</p>
<p>The second way we’ll cover to explore a data frame is using the <code>glimpse()</code> which provides us with an alternative perspective for exploring a data frame than the <code><a href="https://gganimate.com/reference/gganimate-ggproto.html">View()</a></code> function:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb20"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu">glimpse</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">trains</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## Rows: 115
## Columns: 8
## $ gender    &lt;chr&gt; "Female", "Female", "Male", "Male", "Male", "Female", "Fema…
## $ liberal   &lt;lgl&gt; FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE…
## $ party     &lt;chr&gt; "Democrat", "Republican", "Democrat", "Democrat", "Democrat…
## $ age       &lt;dbl&gt; 31, 34, 63, 45, 55, 37, 53, 36, 54, 42, 33, 50, 24, 40, 53,…
## $ income    &lt;dbl&gt; 135000, 105000, 135000, 300000, 135000, 87500, 87500, 13500…
## $ att_start &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 9, 3, 11, 8, 13, 13, 10, 12, 9, 10, 11, 13, 6, 8, 13, 7…
## $ treatment &lt;fct&gt; Treated, Treated, Treated, Treated, Control, Treated, Contr…
## $ att_end   &lt;dbl&gt; 11, 10, 5, 11, 5, 13, 13, 11, 12, 10, 9, 9, 13, 7, 8, 13, 8…</code></pre>
<p>Observe that <code>glimpse()</code> will give you the first few entries of each variable in a row after the variable name. In addition, the <em>data type</em> of the variable is given immediately after each variable’s name inside <code>&lt; &gt;</code>. Here, <code>dbl</code> refers to “double”, which is computer coding terminology for quantitative/numerical variables. While not a data type in <code>trains</code>, <code>int</code> refers to “integer” and is another data type that also represents quantitative/numerical variables. “Doubles” take up twice the size to store on a computer compared to integers.</p>
<p>In contrast, <code>chr</code> refers to “character”, which is computer terminology for text data. In most forms, text data, such as the <code>gender</code> or <code>party</code> of a person, are categorical variables. The <code>liberal</code> variable is another data type: <code>lgl</code>. These types of variables represent logical data (True/False). Finally, the <code>trains</code> dataset also includes the data type <code>fct</code>. <code>fct</code> refers to “factor” and describes a variable that is nominal, or in this case the <code>treatment</code> variable.</p>
<p><strong>3. <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Extract.html">$</a></code> operator</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Extract.html">$</a></code> operator allows us to extract and then explore a single variable within a data frame. For example, run the following in your console</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb22"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">trains</span><span class="op">$</span><span class="va">age</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>##   [1] 31 34 63 45 55 37 53 36 54 42 33 50 24 40 53 50 33 33 32 57 41 36 43 25 41
##  [26] 33 44 46 41 28 36 37 38 48 20 52 38 45 55 38 45 44 36 29 42 43 54 39 31 50
##  [51] 60 67 54 44 50 20 57 25 60 44 35 54 52 47 60 47 22 56 50 21 29 45 46 42 23

## [101] 50 31 43 30 54 52 52 50 37 27 55 42 68 52 50</code></pre>
<p>We used the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Extract.html">$</a></code> operator to extract only the <code>age</code> variable and return it as a vector. We’ll only be occasionally exploring data frames using the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Extract.html">$</a></code> operator, instead favoring the <code><a href="https://gganimate.com/reference/gganimate-ggproto.html">View()</a></code> and <code>glimpse()</code> functions.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Basic Plots<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#basic-plots"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>We begin the development of your data science toolbox with data visualization. By visualizing data, we gain valuable insights we couldn’t initially obtain from just looking at the raw data values. We’ll use the <strong>ggplot2</strong> package, as it provides an easy way to customize your plots.</p>
<p>At their most basic, graphics/plots/charts (we use these terms interchangeably in this book) provide a nice way to explore the patterns in data, such as the presence of <em>outliers</em>, <em>distributions</em> of individual variables, and <em>relationships</em> between groups of variables. Graphics are designed to emphasize the findings and insights you want your audience to understand. This does, however, require a balancing act. On the one hand, you want to highlight as many interesting findings as possible. On the other hand, you don’t want to include so much information that it overwhelms your audience.</p>
<p>We can break a graphic into the following three essential components:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<code>data</code>: the dataset containing the variables of interest.</li>
<li>
<code>geom</code>: the geometric object in question. This refers to the type of object we can observe in a plot. For example: points, lines, and bars.</li>
<li>
<code>aes</code>: aesthetic attributes of the geometric object. For example, x/y position, color, shape, and size. Aesthetic attributes are <em>mapped</em> to variables in the dataset.</li>
</ol>
<div class="figure">
<span id="fig:unnamed-chunk-33"></span>
<img src="01-visualization/images/ggplot2_exploratory.png" alt="Artwork by Allison Horst" width="100%"><p class="caption">
Figure 1.1: Artwork by Allison Horst
</p>
</div>
<p>These three components are specified in the <code>ggplot()</code> function included in the <strong>ggplot2</strong> package. For the purposes of this book, we’ll always provide the <code>ggplot()</code> function with the following arguments (i.e., inputs) at a minimum:</p>
<ul>
<li>The data frame where the variables exist: the <code>data</code> argument.</li>
<li>The mapping of the variables to aesthetic attributes: the <code>mapping</code> argument which specifies the <code>aes</code>thetic attributes involved.</li>
</ul>
<p>After we’ve specified these components, we then add <em>layers</em> to the plot using the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Arithmetic.html">+</a></code> sign. The most essential layer to add to a plot is the layer that specifies which type of <code>geom</code>etric object we want the plot to involve: points, lines, bars, and others. Other layers we can add to a plot include the plot title, axes labels, visual themes for the plots, and facets.</p>
<p>In February 2006, a Swedish physician and data advocate named Hans Rosling gave a TED talk titled <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen">“The best stats you’ve ever seen”</a> where he presented global economic, health, and development data from the website <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/tools/#_locale_id=en;&amp;chart-type=bubbles">gapminder.org</a>. For example, for data on 142 countries in 2007, let’s consider only a few countries in the following table as a peak into the data.</p>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 142 x 5
##   Country     Continent `Life Expectancy` Population `GDP per Capita`
##   &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;fct&gt;                 &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;int&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 Afghanistan Asia                   43.8   31889923             975.
## 2 Albania     Europe                 76.4    3600523            5937.
## 3 Algeria     Africa                 72.3   33333216            6223.
## # … with 139 more rows</code></pre>
<p>Each row in this table corresponds to a country in 2007. For each row, we have 5 columns:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Country</strong>: Name of country.</li>
<li>
<strong>Continent</strong>: Which of the five continents the country is part of. Note that “Americas” includes countries in both North and South America and that Antarctica is excluded.</li>
<li>
<strong>Life Expectancy</strong>: Life expectancy in years.</li>
<li>
<strong>Population</strong>: Number of people living in the country.</li>
<li>
<strong>GDP per Capita</strong>: Gross domestic product (in US dollars).</li>
</ol>
<p>Now consider the following scatterplot, which plots this for all 142 of the data’s countries.</p>
<!--
Note that R will deal with large numbers using scientific notation.  So in the legend for "Population", 1.25e+09 is 1.25 x 10^9^ = 1,250,000,000 = 1.25 billion. 
-->
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="book_test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-36-1.png" width="672"></div>
<p>Let’s view this plot through the grammar of graphics:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The <code>data</code> variable <strong>GDP per Capita</strong> gets mapped to the <code>x</code>-position <code>aes</code>thetic of the points.</li>
<li>The <code>data</code> variable <strong>Life Expectancy</strong> gets mapped to the <code>y</code>-position <code>aes</code>thetic of the points.</li>
<li>The <code>data</code> variable <strong>Population</strong> gets mapped to the <code>size</code> <code>aes</code>thetic of the points.</li>
<li>The <code>data</code> variable <strong>Continent</strong> gets mapped to the <code>color</code> <code>aes</code>thetic of the points.</li>
</ol>
<p>We’ll see shortly that <code>data</code> corresponds to the particular data frame where our data is saved and that “data variables” correspond to particular columns in the data frame. Furthermore, the type of <code>geom</code>etric object considered in this plot are points. That being said, while in this example we are considering points, graphics are not limited to just points. We can also use lines, bars, and other geometric objects.</p>
<p>Let’s take a tour of some of the more useful geoms.</p>
<div id="geom_point" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> <code>geom_point()</code><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#geom_point"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p><em>Scatterplots</em>, also called <em>bivariate plots</em>, allow you to visualize the <em>relationship</em> between two numerical variables. Specifically, we will visualize the relationship between the following two numerical variables in the <code>flights</code> data frame included in the <code>nycflights13</code> package:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<code>dep_delay</code>: departure delay on the horizontal “x” axis and</li>
<li>
<code>arr_delay</code>: arrival delay on the vertical “y” axis</li>
</ol>
<p>for Alaska Airlines flights leaving NYC in 2013. This requires paring down the data from all 336,776 flights that left NYC in 2013, to only the 714 <em>Alaska Airlines</em> flights that left NYC in 2013. We do this so our scatterplot will involve a manageable 714 points, and not an overwhelmingly large number like 336,776. To achieve this, we’ll take the <code>flights</code> data frame, filter the rows so that only the 714 rows corresponding to Alaska Airlines flights are kept, and save this in a new data frame called <code>alaska_flights</code> using the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/assignOps.html">&lt;-</a></code> <em>assignment</em> operator:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb25"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">alaska_flights</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="va">flights</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span> 
  <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html">filter</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">carrier</span> <span class="op">==</span> <span class="st">"AS"</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For now, we suggest you don’t worry if you don’t fully understand this code. We’ll see later that this code uses the <strong>dplyr</strong> package in the tidyverse to achieve our goal: it takes the <code>flights</code> data frame and <code>filter</code>s it to only return the rows where <code>carrier</code> is equal to <code>"AS"</code>, Alaska Airlines’ carrier code. Testing for equality is specified with <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Comparison.html">==</a></code> and not <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/assignOps.html">=</a></code>. Convince yourself that this code achieves what it is supposed to by exploring the resulting data frame by running <code><a href="https://gganimate.com/reference/gganimate-ggproto.html">View(alaska_flights)</a></code>. You’ll see that it has 714 rows, consisting of only 714 Alaska Airlines flights.</p>
<p>Let’s now go over the code that will create the desired scatterplot and break it down piece-by-piece.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb26"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu">ggplot</span><span class="op">(</span>data <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">alaska_flights</span>, mapping <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu">aes</span><span class="op">(</span>x <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">dep_delay</span>, y <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">arr_delay</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">+</span> 
  <span class="fu">geom_point</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Within the <code>ggplot()</code> function, we specify two of the plot’s components as arguments (i.e., inputs):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The <code>data</code> as the <code>alaska_flights</code> data frame via <code>data = alaska_flights</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>aes</code>thetic <code>mapping</code> by setting <code>mapping = aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay)</code>. Specifically, the variable <code>dep_delay</code> maps to the <code>x</code> position aesthetic, while the variable <code>arr_delay</code> maps to the <code>y</code> position.</li>
</ol>
<p>We then add a layer to the <code>ggplot()</code> function call using the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Arithmetic.html">+</a></code> sign. The added layer in question specifies the third component: the <code>geom</code>etric object. In this case, the geometric object is set to be points by specifying <code>geom_point()</code>. After running these two lines of code in your console, you’ll notice two outputs: a warning message and the following graphic shown.</p>
<pre><code>## Warning: Removed 5 rows containing missing values (geom_point).</code></pre>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="book_test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-39-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></div>
<p>Let’s first unpack the graphic. Observe that a <em>positive relationship</em> exists between <code>dep_delay</code> and <code>arr_delay</code>: as departure delays increase, arrival delays tend to also increase. Observe also the large mass of points clustered near (0, 0), the point indicating flights that neither departed nor arrived late.</p>
<p>Let’s turn our attention to the warning message. R is alerting us to the fact that five rows were ignored due to them being missing. For these 5 rows, either the value for <code>dep_delay</code> or <code>arr_delay</code> or both were missing (recorded in R as <code>NA</code>), and thus these rows were ignored in our plot.</p>
<p>Before we continue, let’s make a few more observations about this code that created the scatterplot. Note that the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Arithmetic.html">+</a></code> sign comes at the end of lines, and not at the beginning. You’ll get an error in R if you put it at the beginning of a line. When adding layers to a plot, you are enCouraged to start a new line after the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Arithmetic.html">+</a></code> (by pressing the Return/Enter button on your keyboard) so that the code for each layer is on a new line. As we add more and more layers to plots, you’ll see this will greatly improve the legibility of your code.</p>
<p>To stress the importance of adding the layer specifying the <code>geom</code>etric object, consider this figure where no layers are added. Because the <code>geom</code>etric object was not specified, we have a blank plot which is not very useful!</p>

</h3>
<p>The large mass of points near (0, 0) in the scatterplot we just plotted can cause some confusion since it is hard to tell the true number of points that are plotted. This is the result of a phenomenon called <em>overplotting</em>. As one may guess, this corresponds to points being plotted on top of each other over and over again. When overplotting occurs, it is difficult to know the number of points being plotted. There are two methods to address the issue of overplotting. Either by</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Adjusting the transparency of the points or</li>
<li>Adding a little random “jitter”, or random “nudges”, to each of the points.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Method 1: Changing the transparency</strong></p>
<p>The first way of addressing overplotting is to change the transparency/opacity of the points by setting the <code>alpha</code> argument in <code>geom_point()</code>. We can change the <code>alpha</code> argument to be any value between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>, where <code>0</code> sets the points to be 100% transparent and <code>1</code> sets the points to be 100% opaque. By default, <code>alpha</code> is set to <code>1</code>. In other words, if we don’t explicitly set an <code>alpha</code> value, R will use <code>alpha = 1</code>.</p>
<p>Note how the following code is identical to the code that created the scatterplot with overplotting, but with <code>alpha = 0.2</code> added to the <code>geom_point()</code> function:</p>

<p>The key feature to note in this plot is that the transparency of the points is cumulative: areas with a high-degree of overplotting are darker, whereas areas with a lower degree are less dark. Note furthermore that there is no <code>aes()</code> surrounding <code>alpha = 0.2</code>. This is because we are not mapping a variable to an aesthetic attribute, but rather merely changing the default setting of <code>alpha</code>. In fact, you’ll receive an error if you try to change the second line to read <code>geom_point(aes(alpha = 0.2))</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Jittering the points</strong></p>
<p>The second way of addressing overplotting is by <em>jittering</em> all the points. This means giving each point a small “nudge” in a random direction. You can think of “jittering” as shaking the points around a bit on the plot. Let’s illustrate using a simple example first. Say we have a data frame with 4 identical rows of x and y values: (0,0), (0,0), (0,0), and (0,0). We present both the regular scatterplot of these 4 points (on the left) and its jittered counterpart (on the right).</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="book_test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-42-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></div>
<p>In the left-hand regular scatterplot, observe that the 4 points are superimposed on top of each other. While we know there are 4 values being plotted, this fact might not be apparent to others. In the right-hand jittered scatterplot, it is now plainly evident that this plot involves four points since each point is given a random “nudge.”</p>
<p>Keep in mind, however, that jittering is strictly a visualization tool; even after creating a jittered scatterplot, the original values saved in the data frame remain unchanged.</p>
<p>To create a jittered scatterplot, instead of using <code>geom_point()</code>, we use <code>geom_jitter()</code>. Observe how the following code is very similar to the code that created the scatterplot with overplotting, but with <code>geom_point()</code> replaced with <code>geom_jitter()</code>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb30"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu">ggplot</span><span class="op">(</span>data <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">alaska_flights</span>, mapping <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu">aes</span><span class="op">(</span>x <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">dep_delay</span>, y <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">arr_delay</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">+</span>

<div class="inline-figure"><img src="book_test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-43-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></div>
<p>In order to specify how much jitter to add, we adjusted the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> arguments to <code>geom_jitter()</code>. This corresponds to how hard you’d like to shake the plot in horizontal x-axis units and vertical y-axis units, respectively. In this case, both axes are in minutes. How much jitter should we add using the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> arguments? On the one hand, it is important to add just enough jitter to break any overlap in points, but on the other hand, not so much that we completely alter the original pattern in points.</p>
<p>As can be seen in the resulting plot, in this case jittering doesn’t really provide much new insight. In this particular case, it can be argued that changing the transparency of the points by setting <code>alpha</code> proved more effective. When would it be better to use a jittered scatterplot? When would it be better to alter the points’ transparency? There is no single right answer that applies to all situations. You need to make a subjective choice and own that choice. At the very least when confronted with overplotting, however, we suggest you make both types of plots and see which one better emphasizes the point you are trying to make.</p>

<p>Linegraphs show the relationship between two numerical variables when the variable on the x-axis, also called the <em>explanatory</em> variable, is of a sequential nature. In other words, there is an inherent ordering to the variable.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/decline.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>The most common examples of linegraphs have some notion of time on the x-axis: hours, days, weeks, years, etc. Since time is sequential, we connect consecutive observations of the variable on the y-axis with a line. Linegraphs that have some notion of time on the x-axis are also called <em>time series</em> plots. Let’s illustrate linegraphs using another dataset in the <code>nycflights13</code> package: the <code>weather</code> data frame.</p>
<p>Let’s explore the <code>weather</code> data frame by running <code><a href="https://gganimate.com/reference/gganimate-ggproto.html">View(weather)</a></code> and <code>glimpse(weather)</code>. Furthermore let’s read the associated help file by running <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/nycflights13/man/weather.html">?weather</a></code> to bring up the help file.</p>
<p>Observe that there is a variable called <code>temp</code> of hourly temperature recordings in Fahrenheit at weather stations near all three major airports in New York City: Newark (<code>origin</code> code <code>EWR</code>), John F. Kennedy International (<code>JFK</code>), and LaGuardia (<code>LGA</code>). However, instead of considering hourly temperatures for all days in 2013 for all three airports, for simplicity let’s only consider hourly temperatures at Newark airport for the first 15 days in January.</p>
<p>Recall in section on scatterplots, we used the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html">filter()</a></code> function to only choose the subset of rows of <code>flights</code> corresponding to Alaska Airlines flights. We similarly use <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html">filter()</a></code> here, but by using the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Logic.html">&amp;</a></code> operator we only choose the subset of rows of <code>weather</code> where the <code>origin</code> is <code>"EWR"</code>, the <code>month</code> is January, <strong>and</strong> the <code>day</code> is between <code>1</code> and <code>15</code>. Recall we performed a similar task in section on scatterplots when creating the <code>alaska_flights</code> data frame of only Alaska Airlines flights, a topic we’ll explore more in the next chapter on data wrangling.</p>

<p>Let’s create a time series plot of the hourly temperatures saved in the <code>early_january_weather</code> data frame by using <code>geom_line()</code> to create a linegraph, instead of using <code>geom_point()</code> like we used previously to create scatterplots:</p>

<div class="inline-figure"><img src="book_test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-46-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></div>
<p>Much as with the <code>ggplot()</code> code that created the scatterplot of departure and arrival delays for Alaska Airlines flights, let’s break down this code piece-by-piece in terms of the grammar of graphics:</p>
<p>Within the <code>ggplot()</code> function call, we specify two of the components of the grammar of graphics as arguments:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The <code>data</code> to be the <code>early_january_weather</code> data frame by setting <code>data = early_january_weather</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>aes</code>thetic <code>mapping</code> by setting <code>mapping = aes(x = time_hour, y = temp)</code>. Specifically, the variable <code>time_hour</code> maps to the <code>x</code> position aesthetic, while the variable <code>temp</code> maps to the <code>y</code> position aesthetic.</li>
</ol>
<p>We add a layer to the <code>ggplot()</code> function call using the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Arithmetic.html">+</a></code> sign. The layer in question specifies the third component of the grammar: the <code>geom</code>etric object in question. In this case, the geometric object is a <code>line</code> set by specifying <code>geom_line()</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="geom_histogram" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.2.4</span> <code>geom_histogram()</code><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#geom_histogram"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Let’s consider the <code>temp</code> variable in the <code>weather</code> data frame once again, but unlike with the linegraphs, let’s say we don’t care about its relationship with time, but rather we only care about how the values of <code>temp</code> <em>distribute</em>. In other words:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What are the smallest and largest values?</li>
<li>What is the “center” or “most typical” value?</li>
<li>How do the values spread out?</li>
<li>What are frequent and infrequent values?</li>
</ol>
<p>One way to visualize this <em>distribution</em> of this single variable <code>temp</code> is to plot them on a horizontal line:</p>
<pre><code>## Warning: Removed 1 rows containing missing values (geom_point).</code></pre>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="book_test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-47-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></div>
<p>This gives us a general idea of how the values of <code>temp</code> distribute: observe that temperatures vary from around
11°F (-11°C) up to 100°F (38°C). Furthermore, there appear to be more recorded temperatures between 40°F and 60°F than outside this range. However, because of the high degree of overplotting in the points, it’s hard to get a sense of exactly how many values are between say 50°F and 55°F.</p>
<p>What is commonly produced instead of the horizontal line plot is known as a <em>histogram</em>. A histogram is a plot that visualizes the <em>distribution</em> of a numerical value as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>We first cut up the x-axis into a series of <em>bins</em>, where each bin represents a range of values.</li>
<li>For each bin, we count the number of observations that fall in the range corresponding to that bin.</li>
<li>Then for each bin, we draw a bar whose height marks the corresponding count.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s drill-down on an example of a histogram.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="book_test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-48-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></div>
<p>Let’s focus only on temperatures between 30°F (-1°C) and 60°F (15°C) for now. Observe that there are three bins of equal width between 30°F and 60°F. Thus we have three bins of width 10°F each: one bin for the 30-40°F range, another bin for the 40-50°F range, and another bin for the 50-60°F range. Since:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The bin for the 30-40°F range has a height of around 5000. In other words, around 5000 of the hourly temperature recordings are between 30°F and 40°F.</li>
<li>The bin for the 40-50°F range has a height of around 4300. In other words, around 4300 of the hourly temperature recordings are between 40°F and 50°F.</li>
<li>The bin for the 50-60°F range has a height of around 3500. In other words, around 3500 of the hourly temperature recordings are between 50°F and 60°F.</li>
</ol>
<p>All nine bins spanning 10°F to 100°F on the x-axis have this interpretation.</p>
<p>Let’s now present the <code>ggplot()</code> code to plot your first histogram! Unlike with scatterplots and linegraphs, there is now only one variable being mapped in <code>aes()</code>: the single numerical variable <code>temp</code>. The y-aesthetic of a histogram, the count of the observations in each bin, gets computed for you automatically. Furthermore, the geometric object layer is now a <code>geom_histogram()</code>. After running the following code to create a histogram of hourly temperatures at three NYC airports, you’ll see the histogram as well as warning messages. We’ll discuss the warning messages first.</p>

<div class="inline-figure"><img src="book_test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-49-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></div>
<p>The first message is telling us that the histogram was constructed using <code>bins = 30</code> for 30 equally spaced bins. This is known in computer programming as a default value; unless you override this default number of bins with a number you specify, R will choose 30 by default. We’ll see in the next section how to change the number of bins to another value than the default.</p>
<p>The second message is telling us something similar to the warning message we received when we ran the code to create a scatterplot of departure and arrival delays for Alaska Airlines flights: that because one row has a missing <code>NA</code> value for <code>temp</code>, it was omitted from the histogram. R is just giving us a friendly heads up that this was the case.</p>
<p>Now let’s unpack the resulting histogram. Observe that values less than 25°F as well as values above 80°F are rather rare. However, because of the large number of bins, it’s hard to get a sense for which range of temperatures is spanned by each bin; everything is one giant amorphous blob. So let’s add white vertical borders demarcating the bins by adding a <code>color = "white"</code> argument to <code>geom_histogram()</code> and ignore the warning about setting the number of bins to a better value:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb37"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu">ggplot</span><span class="op">(</span>data <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">weather</span>, mapping <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu">aes</span><span class="op">(</span>x <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">temp</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">+</span>

<div class="inline-figure"><img src="book_test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-50-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></div>
<p>We now have an easier time associating ranges of temperatures to each of the bins. We can also vary the color of the bars by setting the <code>fill</code> argument. For example, you can set the bin colors to be “blue steel” by setting <code>fill = "steelblue"</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb38"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu">ggplot</span><span class="op">(</span>data <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">weather</span>, mapping <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu">aes</span><span class="op">(</span>x <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">temp</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">+</span>

<p>If you’re curious, run <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/grDevices/colors.html">colors()</a></code> to see all 657 possible choice of colors in R!</p>
<p>Observe in the last histogram we created that in the 50-75°F range there appear to be roughly 8 bins. Thus each bin has width 25 divided by 8, or 3.125°F, which is not a very easily interpretable range to work with. Let’s improve this by adjusting the number of bins in our histogram in one of two ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>By adjusting the number of bins via the <code>bins</code> argument to <code>geom_histogram()</code>.</li>
<li>By adjusting the width of the bins via the <code>binwidth</code> argument to <code>geom_histogram()</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Using the first method, we have the power to specify how many bins we would like to cut the x-axis up in. As mentioned in the previous section, the default number of bins is 30. We can override this default, to say 40 bins, as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb39"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu">ggplot</span><span class="op">(</span>data <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">weather</span>, mapping <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu">aes</span><span class="op">(</span>x <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">temp</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">+</span>

<p>Using the second method, instead of specifying the number of bins, we specify the width of the bins by using the <code>binwidth</code> argument in the <code>geom_histogram()</code> layer. For example, let’s set the width of each bin to be 10°F.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb40"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>While faceted histograms are one type of visualization used to compare the distribution of a numerical variable split by the values of another variable, another type of visualization that achieves this same goal is a <em>side-by-side boxplot</em>. A boxplot is constructed from the information provided in the <em>five-number summary</em> of a numerical variable.</p>
<p>To keep things simple for now, let’s only consider the 2141 hourly temperature recordings for the month of November, each represented as a jittered point.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="book_test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-56-1.png" width="672"></div>
<p>These 2141 observations have the following <em>five-number summary</em>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Minimum: 21°F</li>
<li>First quartile (25th percentile): 36°F</li>
<li>Median (second quartile, 50th percentile): 45°F</li>
<li>Third quartile (75th percentile): 52°F</li>
<li>Maximum: 71°F</li>
</ol>
<p>In the leftmost plot, let’s mark these 5 values with dashed horizontal lines on top of the 2141 points. In the middle plot, let’s add the <em>boxplot</em>. In the rightmost plot, let’s remove the points and the dashed horizontal lines for clarity’s sake.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="book_test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-57-1.png" width="672"></div>
<p>What the boxplot does is visually summarize the
2141 points by cutting the 2141 temperature recordings into <em>quartiles</em> at the dashed lines, where each quartile contains
roughly 2141 <span class="math inline">\(\div\)</span> 4 <span class="math inline">\(\approx\)</span>
535 observations. Thus</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>25% of points fall below the bottom edge of the box, which is the first quartile of 36°F. In other words, 25% of observations were below 36°F.</li>
<li>25% of points fall between the bottom edge of the box and the solid middle line, which is the median of 45°F. Thus, 25% of observations were between 36°F and 45°F and 50% of observations were below 45°F.</li>
<li>25% of points fall between the solid middle line and the top edge of the box, which is the third quartile of 52°F. It follows that 25% of observations were between 45°F and 52°F and 75% of observations were below 52°F.</li>
<li>25% of points fall above the top edge of the box. In other words, 25% of observations were above 52°F.</li>
<li>The middle 50% of points lie within the <em>interquartile range (IQR)</em> between the first and third quartile. Thus, the IQR for this example is 52 - 36 = 16°F. The interquartile range is a measure of a numerical variable’s <em>spread</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Furthermore, in the rightmost plot, we see the <em>whiskers</em> of the boxplot. The whiskers stick out from either end of the box all the way to the minimum and maximum observed temperatures of 21°F and 71°F, respectively. However, the whiskers don’t always extend to the smallest and largest observed values as they do here. They in fact extend no more than 1.5 <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> the interquartile range from either end of the box. In this case of the November temperatures, no more than 1.5 <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> 16°F = 24°F from either end of the box. Any observed values outside this range get marked with points called <em>outliers</em>, which we’ll see in the next section.</p>
<p>Let’s now create a side-by-side boxplot of hourly temperatures split by the 12 months as we did previously with the faceted histograms. We do this by mapping the <code>month</code> variable to the x-position aesthetic, the <code>temp</code> variable to the y-position aesthetic, and by adding a <code>geom_boxplot()</code> layer:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb41"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu">ggplot</span><span class="op">(</span>data <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">weather</span>, mapping <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu">aes</span><span class="op">(</span>x <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">month</span>, y <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">temp</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">+</span>
  <span class="fu">geom_boxplot</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## Warning: Continuous x aesthetic -- did you forget aes(group=...)?</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning: Removed 1 rows containing non-finite values (stat_boxplot).</code></pre>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="book_test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-58-1.png" width="672"></div>
<p>Observe that this plot does not provide information about temperature separated by month. The first warning message clues us in as to why. It is telling us that we have a “continuous”, or numerical variable, on the x-position aesthetic. Boxplots, however, require a categorical variable to be mapped to the x-position aesthetic. The second warning message is identical to the warning message when plotting a histogram of hourly temperatures: that one of the values was recorded as <code>NA</code> missing.</p>
<p>We can convert the numerical variable <code>month</code> into a <code>factor</code> categorical variable by using the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/factor.html">factor()</a></code> function. So after applying <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/factor.html">factor(month)</a></code>, month goes from having numerical values 1, 2, …, and 12 to having an associated ordering.

<p>The resulting plot shows 12 separate “box and whiskers” plots similar to the rightmost plot of the figure of only November temperatures. Thus the different boxplots are shown “side-by-side.”</p>
<ul>
<li>The “box” portions of the visualization represent the 1st quartile, the median (the 2nd quartile), and the 3rd quartile.</li>
<li>The height of each box (the value of the 3rd quartile minus the value of the 1st quartile) is the interquartile range (IQR). It is a measure of the spread of the middle 50% of values, with longer boxes indicating more variability.</li>
<li>The “whisker” portions of these plots extend out from the bottoms and tops of the boxes and represent points less than the 25th percentile and greater than the 75th percentiles, respectively. They’re set to extend out no more than <span class="math inline">\(1.5 \times IQR\)</span> units away from either end of the boxes. We say “no more than” because the ends of the whiskers have to correspond to observed temperatures. The length of these whiskers show how the data outside the middle 50% of values vary, with longer whiskers indicating more variability.</li>
<li>The dots representing values falling outside the whiskers are called <em>outliers</em>. These can be thought of as anomalous (“out-of-the-ordinary”) values.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to keep in mind that the definition of an outlier is somewhat arbitrary and not absolute. In this case, they are defined by the length of the whiskers, which are no more
than <span class="math inline">\(1.5 \times IQR\)</span> units long for each boxplot. Looking at this side-by-side plot we can see, as expected, that summer months (6 through 8) have higher median temperatures as evidenced by the higher solid lines in the middle of the boxes. We can easily compare temperatures across months by drawing imaginary horizontal lines across the plot. Furthermore, the heights of the 12 boxes as quantified by the interquartile ranges are informative too; they tell us about variability, or spread, of temperatures recorded in a given month.</p>

<p>Both histograms and boxplots are tools to visualize the distribution of numerical variables. Another commonly desired task is to visualize the distribution of a categorical variable. This is a simpler task, as we are simply counting different categories within a categorical variable, also known as the <em>levels</em> of the categorical variable. Often the best way to visualize these different counts, also known as <em>frequencies</em>, is with barplots (also called barcharts).</p>

<p>Let’s now look at the <code>flights</code> data frame in the <code>nycflights13</code> package and visualize the distribution of the categorical variable <code>carrier</code>. In other words, let’s visualize the number of domestic flights out of New York City each airline company flew in 2013. Since each row in the <code>flights</code> data frame corresponds to a flight, the <code>flights</code> data frame is like the <code>fruits</code> data frame because the flights have not been pre-counted by <code>carrier</code>. Thus we should use <code>geom_bar()</code> to create a barplot. Much like a <code>geom_histogram()</code>, there is only one variable in the <code>aes()</code> aesthetic mapping: the variable <code>carrier</code> gets mapped to the <code>x</code>-position. As a difference though, histograms have bars that touch whereas bar graphs have white space between the bars going from left to right.</p>

<p>One of the most common plots used to visualize the distribution of categorical data is the pie chart. While they may seem harmless enough, pie charts actually present a problem in that humans are unable to judge angles well. <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="robbins2013"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> argues that we overestimate angles greater than 90 degrees and we underestimate angles less than 90 degrees. In other words, it is difficult for us to determine the relative size of one piece of the pie compared to another.</p>
<p>While pie charts present information in a way such that comparisons must be made by comparing angles, barplots are more effective because they present the information in a way such that comparisons between categories can be made with single horizontal lines.</p>

<p>Barplots are a very common way to visualize the frequency of different categories, or levels, of a single categorical variable. Another use of barplots is to visualize the <em>joint</em> distribution of two categorical variables at the same time. Let’s examine the <em>joint</em> distribution of outgoing domestic flights from NYC by <code>carrier</code> as well as <code>origin</code>. In other words, the number of flights for each <code>carrier</code> and <code>origin</code> combination.</p>
<p>For example, the number of WestJet flights from <code>JFK</code>, the number of WestJet flights from <code>LGA</code>, the number of WestJet flights from <code>EWR</code>, the number of American Airlines flights from <code>JFK</code>, and so on. Recall the <code>ggplot()</code> code that created the barplot of <code>carrier</code> frequency:</p>

<p>This is an example of a <em>stacked barplot</em>. While simple to make, in certain aspects it is not ideal. For example, it is difficult to compare the heights of the different colors between the bars, corresponding to comparing the number of flights from each <code>origin</code> airport between the carriers.</p>
<p>Before we continue, let’s address some common points of confusion among new R users. First, the <code>fill</code> aesthetic corresponds to the color used to fill the bars, while the <code>color</code> aesthetic corresponds to the color of the outline of the bars. This is identical to how we added color to our histogram in the <code>geom_histogram</code> section: we set the outline of the bars to white by setting <code>color = "white"</code> and the colors of the bars to blue steel by setting <code>fill = "steelblue"</code>. Observe that mapping <code>origin</code> to <code>color</code> and not <code>fill</code> yields grey bars with different colored outlines.</p>

<p>Second, note that <code>fill</code> is another aesthetic mapping much like <code>x</code>-position; thus we were careful to include it within the parentheses of the <code>aes()</code> mapping. The following code, where the <code>fill</code> aesthetic is specified outside the <code>aes()</code> mapping will yield an error. This is a fairly common error that new <code>ggplot</code> users make:</p>

<p>An alternative to stacked barplots are <em>side-by-side barplots</em>, also known as <em>dodged barplots</em>.

In other words, we are overriding the default barplot type, which is a <em>stacked</em> barplot, and specifying it to be a side-by-side barplot instead.</p>

<p>Another method to fit a line to a scatter plot is called the <code>loess</code> method, which computes a smooth local regression and is the default value for a small number of observations. You can read more about loess using the R code <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/loess.html">?loess</a></code> in your console.</p>

<p>Let’s start by introducing a new concept called <em>faceting</em>. Faceting is used when we’d like to split a particular visualization by the values of another variable. This will create multiple copies of the same type of plot with matching x and y axes, but whose content will differ.</p>
<p>If we look at the plot above, it is quite difficult to compare the continents despite the colors. It would be much easier if we could “split” this scatterplot by the 5 continents in the dataset. In other words, we would create plots of <code>gdpPercap</code> and <code>lifeExp</code> for each <code>continent</code> separately. We do this by adding a <code>facet_wrap(~ continent)</code> layer. Note the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/tilde.html">~</a></code> is a “tilde” and can generally be found on the key next to the “1” key on US keyboards.

<p>This is way better! However, R chooses by default 2 plots per row, so that Asia and Europe are below the other two continents. We can specify the number of rows and columns in the grid by using the <code>nrow</code> and <code>ncol</code> arguments inside of <code>facet_wrap()</code>. Let’s get all continents in a row by setting nrow = 1:</p>

<p>The next layer are stats, or <code>stat</code>istical transformations. ggplot provides us with many different ones, but most of them are only suitable for certain types of geoms. Take for example <code>stat_boxplot()</code>, which is applicable to scatterplots and adds boxplots to our plot:</p>

<p>Now we not only recognize the differences between the continents, but also within the continents better. However, the interpretation of box plots is not so intuitive, at least at first glance. An easier to understand alternative is a line of best fit, which we can add with <code>stat_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = "lm", se = FALSE)</code>:</p>

<p>Next, we can specify the type of coordinate system. In most cases we will use Cartesian coordinate systems, which are set with <code>coord_cartesian()</code>. R draws every plot by default with this method, so we don’t need to determine it specifically. Depending on the data we are working with, more exotic variants like <code>coord_polar()</code> or <code>coord_map()</code> may be helpful.</p>
<p>A coordinate system that is used more often is <code>coord_flip()</code>. This is actually just a Cartesian coordinate system, but as the name suggests, it simply swaps the axes:</p>

<p>As can be seen, lifeExp is now on the x-axis and gdpPercap on the y-axis. Compared to the previous plot it is now easier to observe the distribution of life expectancy in the respective continents. For example, we can see that many countries in Africa are at about 55 years, in the Americas and Asia at 75 years, and in Europe at 80 years. However, we think it makes more sense to consider <code>lifeExp</code> as the dependent variable, so don’t use <code>coord_flip()</code> in the subsequent plots.</p>

<p>We can also use ggplot to change the position of the plot content. Positions are rather “cosmetic” elements, which make plots easier to understand. As before, there are many different options to do this, which often only work for certain geoms. For example, when we work with barplots, we can use <code>position_dodge()</code> or <code>position_stack()</code> to specify whether we want to arrange the bars in the plot side by side or on top of each other. For scatterplots like ours, <code>position_jitter()</code> can be used:</p>

<p>Notice several things about this code. First, positions should be placed in the geom they refer to (in our case <code>geom_point()</code>). Second, positions always start with <code>position =</code> followed by the position type (in our case <code>position_jitter()</code>). The width and height are optional and can be freely defined. You might wonder what the difference between <code>position_jitter()</code> and <code>geom_jitter()</code> is. The answer is: Nothing. In R there are often several functions which can lead to the same result. However, it is practical to start with <code>geom_point()</code> first, because then you still have the choice of changing the position by shaking the dots - with <code>geom_jitter()</code> the plot is constructed like this from the beginning.</p>
<p>Besides the position we can also manipulate the limits of the axes by using <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.window.html">xlim()</a></code> and <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.window.html">ylim()</a></code>. For example, assume that we are only interested in countries with a GDP per capita from 0 to 30000. We can tell R as follows that we only want to see this range. Note that, because <code>data</code> is the first argument and <code>mapping</code> is the second to <code>ggplot()</code>, we don’t actually have to name the arguments. We can just provide them, as long as they are in the correct order.</p>

<p>We can see that the GDP per capita on the y-axis is now only shown from 0 to 30000.</p>
<p>Finally we can change the scaling of the axes. For example, it might be useful to display the axes with <code>scale_x_log10()</code> or <code>scale_y_log10()</code> on a logarithmic scale. Let’s try this out on GDP per capita. Also, note that we can (lazily!) not provide the explicit <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> argument names to <code>aes()</code> as long as we provide the values in the right order: <code>x</code> comes before <code>y</code>.</p>

<p>If a <code>title</code> or other <code>labs()</code> argument is too long, you can insert a newline character — a “\n” — in the middle, which will cause the <code>title</code> to take up two lines rather than one. This is the simplest way to deal with titles or axis labels which are too long.</p>
<p>It is up to us, which or how many of the arguments in <code>labs()</code> we use. While most arguments are probably self-explanatory, it makes sense to have a look at the last one. It determines the title of the legend, and should always be named after the aesthetic to which the legend refers. Since the legend was created by the <em>color</em> argument in the density plot, we can refer to it with <code>color =</code>.</p>
<p>We can also change labels within the plots. Wouldn’t it be great if we knew which country each point refers to? We can do this with the help of <code>geom_text()</code>:</p>

<p>Let’s go over some important points about specifying the arguments (i.e., inputs) to functions. Run the following two segments of code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb88"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu">ggplot</span><span class="op">(</span>data <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">flights</span>, mapping <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu">aes</span><span class="op">(</span>x <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">carrier</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">+</span>
  <span class="fu">geom_bar</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb89"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

  <span class="fu">geom_bar</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You’ll notice that both code segments create the same barplot, even though in the second segment we omitted the <code>data =</code> and <code>mapping =</code> code argument names. This is because the <code>ggplot()</code> function by default assumes that the <code>data</code> argument comes first and the <code>mapping</code> argument comes second. As long as you specify the data frame in question first and the <code>aes()</code> mapping second, you can omit the explicit statement of the argument names <code>data =</code> and <code>mapping =</code>.</p>
<p>Going forward for the rest of this book, all <code>ggplot()</code> code will be like the second segment: with the <code>data =</code> and <code>mapping =</code> explicit naming of the argument omitted with the default ordering of arguments respected. We’ll do this for brevity’s sake; it’s common to see this style when reviewing other R users’ code.</p>
<p>Data “in the wild” is never ready for visualization. We can’t use all the beautiful plots that we learned in the previous chapter until we have “wrangled” the data into a convenient shape. In this chapter, we’ll introduce a series of functions from the <strong>tidyverse</strong> collection of packages which help with wrangling, and everything else we need to do to work with data. Such functions include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html">filter()</a></code> a data frame’s existing rows to only pick out a subset of them. For example, the <code>alaska_flights</code> data frame.</li>
<li>
<code>select()</code> specific variable columns in a data set. For example, choose the <code>dep_delay</code> and <code>arr_delay</code> variables to more easily view the relationship between the two. Additional functions like <code>slice()</code> can further subset the data.</li>
<li>
<code>arrange()</code> its rows. For example, sort the rows of <code>weather</code> in ascending or descending order of <code>temp</code>.</li>
<li>
<code>group_by()</code> its rows. In other words, assign different rows to be part of the same <em>group</em>. We can then combine <code>group_by()</code> with <code>summarize()</code> to report summary statistics for each group <em>separately</em>. For example, say you don’t want a single overall average departure delay <code>dep_delay</code> for all three <code>origin</code> airports combined, but rather three separate average departure delays, one computed for each of the three <code>origin</code> airports.</li>
<li>
<code>mutate()</code> its existing columns/variables to create new ones. For example, convert hourly temperature recordings from degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius.</li>
</ol>
<!-- DK: Mention summarize() --><p>Notice how we used <code>computer_code</code> font to describe the actions we want to take on our data frames. This is because the <strong>dplyr</strong> package, one of the packages in the <strong>tidyverse</strong>, has intuitively verb-named functions that are easy to remember.</p>
<p>There is a further benefit to learning to use the <strong>dplyr</strong> package for data wrangling: its similarity to the database querying language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a> (pronounced “sequel” or spelled out as “S”, “Q”, “L”). SQL (which stands for “Structured Query Language”) is used to manage large databases quickly and efficiently and is widely used by many institutions with a lot of data. While SQL is a topic left for a book or a course on database management, keep in mind that once you learn <strong>dplyr</strong>, you can learn SQL easily.</p>
<div id="the-pipe-operator" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">1.4.1</span> The pipe operator: <code>%&gt;%</code><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-pipe-operator"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Before we start data wrangling, let’s first introduce a nifty tool that gets loaded with the <strong>dplyr</strong> package included in the tidyverse: the pipe operator <code>%&gt;%</code>. The pipe operator allows us to combine multiple operations in R into a single sequential <em>chain</em> of actions.</p>
<p>Recall from chapter 1 that to add the <code>geom</code> layer to your ggplot you had format your code as:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb90"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu">ggplot</span><span class="op">(</span>data <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">flights</span>, mapping <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu">aes</span><span class="op">(</span>x <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">carrier</span>, fill <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">origin</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">+</span>
  <span class="fu">geom_bar</span><span class="op">(</span>position <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"dodge"</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Without the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Arithmetic.html">+</a></code> at the end of the first row, your computer would not know to continue onto the second. The same would occur without a pipe operator. For instance, take a look at the following code. You can run it in your own Rstudio console. What happens?</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb91"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">alaska_flights</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="va">flights</span> 
  <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html">filter</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">carrier</span> <span class="op">==</span> <span class="st">"AS"</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Without the pipe operator, the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html">filter()</a></code> function cannot work because the computer does not know to use the flights dataset for the operation within the parentheses. This will become clearer with more practice using <strong>dplyr</strong> functions.<br><!-- EF: How do I use the index. It might be nice to define argument within the index --></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb92"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">alaska_flights</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="va">flights</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span> 
  <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html">filter</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">carrier</span> <span class="op">==</span> <span class="st">"AS"</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The result will be the transformed/modified data frame that you want. In our example, we’ll save the result in a new data frame by using the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/assignOps.html">&lt;-</a></code> assignment operator with the name <code>alaska_flights</code> via <code>alaska_flights &lt;-</code>. Because we assigned this modified data frame to <code>alaska_flights</code>, it is a separate entity from the initial <code>flights</code> data frame. If, however, we had written the code as <code>flights &lt;- flights</code> you would have overwritten the previous data frame, and the original <code>flights</code> data from the **nycflights13* package would have to be re-installed to access it again.</p>
<p>Much like when adding layers to a <code>ggplot()</code> using the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Arithmetic.html">+</a></code> sign, you form a single <em>chain</em> of data wrangling operations by combining verb-named functions into a single sequence using the pipe operator <code>%&gt;%</code>. Furthermore, much like how the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Arithmetic.html">+</a></code> sign has to come at the end of lines when constructing plots, the pipe operator <code>%&gt;%</code> has to come at the end of lines as well. Note also that the pipe operator can be used multiple times sequentially. Simply include it at the end of your line, and the following function will be immediately linked to the output of the previous line containing the operator. We call the text within the parentheses the argument(s) of a function.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that most <strong>dplyr</strong> verbs, as well as most functions in the larger <strong>tidyverse</strong>, achieve this effect by always having their first argument be an input tibble. For example, look at <code><a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html">?dplyr::filter</a></code> to see that, for example, the first argument of <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html">filter()</a></code> is a tibble named <code>.data</code>. So, we can rewrite the above code snippet as:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb93"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">alaska_flights</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="va">flights</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span> 
  <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html">filter</a></span><span class="op">(</span>.data <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">.</span>, <span class="va">carrier</span> <span class="op">==</span> <span class="st">"AS"</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The “.” serves as special role when using pipes. It represents the tibble which was “passed down” from the previous step in the pipe. Here, we are telling R that “.” — which is <code>flights</code> in this case — is the first argument to <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html">filter()</a></code>. Since argument names do not have to be used, we can rewrite this as:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb94"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">alaska_flights</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="va">flights</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span> 
  <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html">filter</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">.</span>, <span class="va">carrier</span> <span class="op">==</span> <span class="st">"AS"</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You will almost never write code that looks like this, at least with simple <strong>dplyr</strong> verbs like <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html">filter()</a></code>. But, behind the scenes, this is what is going on. And, in more advanced cases, we will need to use “.” to refer to the passed-in tibble.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, there are many more advanced data wrangling functions than just the six listed in the introduction to this chapter; you’ll see some examples of these in Section <a href="#other-verbs"><strong>??</strong></a>. However, just with these six verb-named functions you’ll be able to perform a broad array of data wrangling tasks for the rest of this book.</p>

<p>The <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html">filter()</a></code> function here works much like the “Filter” option in Microsoft Excel; it allows you to specify criteria about the values of a variable in your dataset and then filters out only the rows that match that criteria.</p>
<p>We begin by focusing only on flights from New York City to Portland, Oregon. The <code>dest</code> destination code (or airport code) for Portland, Oregon is <code>"PDX"</code>. Run the following and look at the results in RStudio’s spreadsheet viewer to ensure that only flights heading to Portland are chosen here:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb95"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">portland_flights</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="va">flights</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span> 
  <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html">filter</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">dest</span> <span class="op">==</span> <span class="st">"PDX"</span><span class="op">)</span>
<span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/View.html">View</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">portland_flights</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note the order of the code. First, take the <code>flights</code> data frame <code>flights</code> <em>then</em> <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html">filter()</a></code> the data frame so that only those where the <code>dest</code> equals <code>"PDX"</code> are included. We test for equality using the double equal sign <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Comparison.html">==</a></code> and not a single equal sign <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/assignOps.html">=</a></code>. In other words <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html">filter(dest = "PDX")</a></code> will yield an error. This is a convention across many programming languages. If you are new to coding, you’ll probably forget to use the double equal sign <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Comparison.html">==</a></code> a few times before you get the hang of it.</p>
<p>You can use other operators beyond just the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Comparison.html">==</a></code> operator that tests for equality:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Comparison.html">&gt;</a></code> corresponds to “greater than”</li>
<li>
<code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Comparison.html">&lt;</a></code> corresponds to “less than”</li>
<li>
<code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Comparison.html">&gt;=</a></code> corresponds to “greater than or equal to”</li>
<li>
<code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Comparison.html">&lt;=</a></code> corresponds to “less than or equal to”</li>
<li>
<code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Comparison.html">!=</a></code> corresponds to “not equal to.” The <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Logic.html">!</a></code> is used in many programming languages to indicate “not.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, you can combine multiple criteria using operators that make comparisons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Logic.html">|</a></code> corresponds to “or”</li>
<li>
<code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Logic.html">&amp;</a></code> corresponds to “and”</li>
</ul>
<p>To see many of these in action, let’s filter <code>flights</code> for all rows that departed from JFK <em>and</em> were heading to Burlington, Vermont (<code>"BTV"</code>) or Seattle, Washington (<code>"SEA"</code>) <em>and</em> departed in the months of October, November, or December. Run the following:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb96"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">btv_sea_flights_fall</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="va">flights</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span> 
  <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html">filter</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">origin</span> <span class="op">==</span> <span class="st">"JFK"</span> <span class="op">&amp;</span> 
           <span class="op">(</span><span class="va">dest</span> <span class="op">==</span> <span class="st">"BTV"</span> <span class="op">|</span> <span class="va">dest</span> <span class="op">==</span> <span class="st">"SEA"</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">&amp;</span> 
           <span class="va">month</span> <span class="op">&gt;=</span> <span class="fl">10</span><span class="op">)</span>
<span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/View.html">View</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">btv_sea_flights_fall</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that even though colloquially speaking one might say “all flights leaving Burlington, Vermont <em>and</em> Seattle, Washington,” in terms of computer operations, we really mean “all flights leaving Burlington, Vermont <em>or</em> leaving Seattle, Washington.” For a given row in the data, <code>dest</code> can be <code>"BTV"</code>, or <code>"SEA"</code>, or something else, but not both <code>"BTV"</code> and <code>"SEA"</code> at the same time. Furthermore, note the careful use of parentheses around <code>dest == "BTV" | dest == "SEA"</code>.</p>
<p>We can often skip the use of <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Logic.html">&amp;</a></code> and just separate our conditions with a comma. The previous code will return the identical output <code>btv_sea_flights_fall</code> as the following code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb97"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">btv_sea_flights_fall</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="va">flights</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span>

         <span class="op">(</span><span class="va">dest</span> <span class="op">==</span> <span class="st">"BTV"</span> <span class="op">|</span> <span class="va">dest</span> <span class="op">==</span> <span class="st">"SEA"</span><span class="op">)</span>, 
         <span class="va">month</span> <span class="op">&gt;=</span> <span class="fl">10</span><span class="op">)</span>         
<span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/View.html">View</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">btv_sea_flights_fall</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s present another example that uses the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Logic.html">!</a></code> “not” operator to pick rows that <em>don’t</em> match a criteria. As mentioned earlier, the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Logic.html">!</a></code> can be read as “not.” Here we are filtering rows corresponding to flights that didn’t go to Burlington, VT or Seattle, WA.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb98"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">not_BTV_SEA</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="va">flights</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span> 
  <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html">filter</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">!</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">dest</span> <span class="op">==</span> <span class="st">"BTV"</span> <span class="op">|</span> <span class="va">dest</span> <span class="op">==</span> <span class="st">"SEA"</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span>

<p>Again, note the careful use of parentheses around the <code>(dest == "BTV" | dest == "SEA")</code>. If we didn’t use parentheses as follows:</p>

<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">flights</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html">filter</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">!</span><span class="va">dest</span> <span class="op">==</span> <span class="st">"BTV"</span> <span class="op">|</span> <span class="va">dest</span> <span class="op">==</span> <span class="st">"SEA"</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We would be returning all flights not headed to <code>"BTV"</code> <em>or</em> those headed to <code>"SEA"</code>, which is an entirely different resulting data frame.</p>
<p>Now say we have a larger number of airports we want to filter for, say <code>"SEA"</code>, <code>"SFO"</code>, <code>"PDX"</code>, <code>"BTV"</code>, and <code>"BDL"</code>. We could continue to use the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Logic.html">|</a></code> (<em>or</em>) operator:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb100"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">many_airports</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="va">flights</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span> 
  <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html">filter</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">dest</span> <span class="op">==</span> <span class="st">"SEA"</span> <span class="op">|</span> <span class="va">dest</span> <span class="op">==</span> <span class="st">"SFO"</span> <span class="op">|</span> <span class="va">dest</span> <span class="op">==</span> <span class="st">"PDX"</span> <span class="op">|</span>

<p>but as we progressively include more airports, this will get unwieldy to write. A slightly shorter approach uses the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/match.html">%in%</a></code> operator along with the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html">c()</a></code> function. Recall from Subsection <a href="#programming-concepts"><strong>??</strong></a> that the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html">c()</a></code> function “combines” or “concatenates” values into a single <em>vector</em> of values.</p>

<p>One of the most common mistakes is to use <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Comparison.html">==</a></code> in this <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html">filter()</a></code> rather than <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/match.html">%in%</a></code>. This is diabolical since it won’t fail and, in certain situations, it might not even issue a warning. Beware!</p>
<p>What this code is doing is filtering <code>flights</code> for all flights where <code>dest</code> is in the vector of airports <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html">c("BTV", "SEA", "PDX", "SFO", "BDL")</a></code>. Both outputs of <code>many_airports</code> are the same, but as you can see the latter takes much less energy to code. The <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/match.html">%in%</a></code> operator is useful for looking for matches commonly in one vector/variable compared to another.</p>
<p>As a final note, we recommend that <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html">filter()</a></code> should often be among the first verbs you consider applying to your data. This cleans your dataset to only those rows you care about, or put differently, it narrows down the scope of your data frame to just the observations you care about.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Using the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html">filter()</a></code> function we were able to pick out specific rows from the dataset. The <code>select()</code> function allows R users to pick specific columns/variables instead.</p>
<p>We’ve seen that the <code>flights</code> data frame in the <code>nycflights13</code> package contains 19 different variables. You can identify the names of these 19 variables by running the <code>glimpse()</code> function from the <strong>dplyr</strong> package:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb102"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu">glimpse</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">flights</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>However, say you only need two of these 19 variables, say <code>carrier</code> and <code>flight</code>. You can <code>select()</code> these two variables:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb103"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">flights</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span> 
  <span class="fu">select</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">carrier</span>, <span class="va">flight</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This function makes it easier to explore large datasets since it allows us to limit the scope to only those variables we care most about. For example, if we <code>select()</code> only a smaller number of variables as is shown in Figure <a href="#fig:selectfig"><strong>??</strong></a>, it will make viewing the dataset in RStudio’s spreadsheet viewer more digestible. Using <code>select()</code> can also be useful for creating <strong>ggplot2</strong> visualizations when you only need a few variables.</p>
<p>Let’s say instead you want to drop, or de-select, certain variables. For example, consider the variable <code>year</code> in the <code>flights</code> data frame. This variable isn’t quite a “variable” because it is always <code>2013</code> and hence doesn’t change. Say you want to remove this variable from the data frame. We can deselect <code>year</code> by using the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Arithmetic.html">-</a></code> sign:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb104"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">flights_no_year</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="va">flights</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span> <span class="fu">select</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">-</span><span class="va">year</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Another way of selecting columns/variables is by specifying a range of columns:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb105"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">flight_arr_times</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="va">flights</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span> <span class="fu">select</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">month</span><span class="op">:</span><span class="va">day</span>, <span class="va">arr_time</span><span class="op">:</span><span class="va">sched_arr_time</span><span class="op">)</span>
<span class="va">flight_arr_times</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will <code>select()</code> all columns between <code>month</code> and <code>day</code> (including the two specified columns), as well as between <code>arr_time</code> and <code>sched_arr_time</code>, and drop the rest.</p>
<p>The <code>select()</code> function can also be used to reorder columns when used with the <code>everything()</code> helper function. For example, suppose we want the <code>hour</code>, <code>minute</code>, and <code>time_hour</code> variables to appear immediately after the <code>year</code>, <code>month</code>, and <code>day</code> variables, while not discarding the rest of the variables. In the following code, <code>everything()</code> will pick up all remaining variables:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb106"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">flights_reorder</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="va">flights</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span> 
  <span class="fu">select</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">year</span>, <span class="va">month</span>, <span class="va">day</span>, <span class="va">hour</span>, <span class="va">minute</span>, <span class="va">time_hour</span>, <span class="fu">everything</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span>
<span class="fu">glimpse</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">flights_reorder</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Lastly, the helper functions <code>starts_with()</code>, <code>ends_with()</code>, and <code>contains()</code> can be used to select variables/columns that match those conditions. As examples,</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb107"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">flights</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span> <span class="fu">select</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fu">starts_with</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"a"</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span>

<p>Unlike <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html">filter()</a></code>, <code>slice()</code> relies on numeric order of the data.</p>
<p><code>pull()</code> grabs out a variable as a vector, rather than leaving it within a tibble, as <code>select()</code> does:</p>

<pre><code>## [1] 533 542 544 554</code></pre>
<p>This is often handy when you want to feed the data into a function, like <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/mean.html">mean()</a></code> which requires a vector as input:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb112"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>One of the most commonly performed data wrangling tasks is to sort a data frame’s rows in the alphanumeric order of one of the variables. Unlike <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html">filter()</a></code> or <code>select()</code>, <code>arrange()</code> does not remove any rows or columns from the data frame. Instead, the <strong>dplyr</strong> package’s <code>arrange()</code> function allows us to sort/reorder a data frame’s rows according to the values of the specified variable.</p>
<p>Suppose we are interested in determining the flight that covers that most distance from all domestic flights departing from New York City in 2013:</p>

<p>This is, however, the opposite of what we want. The rows are sorted with the flights covering the least distance displayed first.

<p>In this code, we <code>mutate()</code> the <code>weather</code> data frame by creating a new variable <code>temp_in_C = (temp - 32) / 1.8</code> and then <em>overwrite</em> the original <code>weather</code> data frame. Why did we overwrite the data frame <code>weather</code>, instead of assigning the result to a new data frame like <code>weather_new</code>? As a rough rule of thumb, as long as you are not losing original information that you might need later, it’s acceptable practice to overwrite existing data frames with updated ones, as we did here. On the other hand, why did we not overwrite the variable <code>temp</code>, but instead created a new variable called <code>temp_in_C</code>? Because if we did this, we would have erased the original information contained in <code>temp</code> of temperatures in Fahrenheit that may still be valuable to us.</p>
<p>Let’s now compute monthly average temperatures in both °F and °C using the <code>group_by()</code> and <code>summarize()</code> code we saw in Section <a href="#groupby"><strong>??</strong></a>:</p>

<p>Let’s consider another example. Passengers are often frustrated when their flight departs late, but aren’t as annoyed if, in the end, pilots can make up some time during the flight. This is known in the airline industry as <em>gain</em>, and we will create this variable using the <code>mutate()</code> function:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb129"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">flights</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="va">flights</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span>

<p>Let’s take a look at only the <code>dep_delay</code>, <code>arr_delay</code>, and the resulting <code>gain</code> variables for the first 5 rows in our updated <code>flights</code> data frame in Table <a href="#tab:first-five-flights"><strong>??</strong></a>.</p>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 5 x 3
##   dep_delay arr_delay  gain
##       &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1         2        11    -9
## 2         4        20   -16
## 3         2        33   -31
## 4        -1       -18    17
## 5        -6       -25    19</code></pre>
<p>The flight in the first row departed 2 minutes late but arrived 11 minutes late, so its “gained time in the air” is a loss of 9 minutes, hence its <code>gain</code> is 2 - 11 = -9. On the other hand, the flight in the fourth row departed a minute early (<code>dep_delay</code> of -1) but arrived 18 minutes early (<code>arr_delay</code> of -18), so its “gained time in the air” is <span class="math inline">\(-1 - (-18) = -1 + 18 = 17\)</span> minutes, hence its <code>gain</code> is +17.</p>
<p>Recall from Section <a href="#histograms"><strong>??</strong></a> that since <code>gain</code> is a numerical variable, we can visualize its distribution using a histogram.</p>

<p>The next common task when working with data frames is to compute <em>summary statistics</em>. Summary statistics are single numerical values that summarize a large number of values. Commonly known examples of summary statistics include the mean (also called the average) and the median (the middle value). Other examples of summary statistics that might not immediately come to mind include the <em>sum</em>, the smallest value also called the <em>minimum</em>, the largest value also called the <em>maximum</em>, and the <em>standard deviation</em>.</p>
<p>Return to a familiar dataset. Let’s calculate two summary statistics of the <code>temp</code> temperature variable in the <code>weather</code> data frame: the mean and standard deviation. To compute these summary statistics, we need the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/mean.html">mean()</a></code> and <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/sd.html">sd()</a></code> <em>summary functions</em> in R. Summary functions in R take in many values and return a single value.</p>

<p>This function offers an array of summary statistics for each of the columns of the dataset, but <code>summarize()</code> (or alternatively <code>summarise()</code>) allows us to calculate these statistics on individual columns of the dataset.</p>
<p>More precisely, we’ll use the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/mean.html">mean()</a></code> and <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/sd.html">sd()</a></code> summary functions within the <code>summarize()</code> function from the <strong>dplyr</strong> package. Note you can also use the British English spelling of <code>summarise()</code>. The <code>summarize()</code> function takes in a data frame and returns a data frame with only one row corresponding to the summary statistics.</p>
<p>We’ll save the results in a new data frame called <code>summary_temp</code> that will have two columns/variables: the <code>mean</code> and the <code>std_dev</code>:</p>

<p>Why are the values returned <code>NA</code>?`<code>NA</code> is how R encodes <em>missing values</em> where <code>NA</code> indicates “not available” or “not applicable.” If a value for a particular row and a particular column does not exist, <code>NA</code> is stored instead. Values can be missing for many reasons. Perhaps the data was collected but someone forgot to enter it? Perhaps the data was not collected at all because it was too difficult to do so? Perhaps there was an erroneous value that someone entered that has been corrected to read as missing? You’ll often encounter issues with missing values when working with real data.</p>
<p>Going back to our <code>summary_temp</code> output, by default any time you try to calculate a summary statistic of a variable that has one or more <code>NA</code> missing values in R, <code>NA</code> is returned. To work around this fact, you can set the <code>na.rm</code> argument to <code>TRUE</code>, where <code>rm</code> is short for “remove”; this will ignore any <code>NA</code> missing values and only return the summary value for all non-missing values.</p>
<p>The code that follows computes the mean and standard deviation of all non-missing values of <code>temp</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb139"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>Notice how the <code>na.rm = TRUE</code> are used as arguments to the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/mean.html">mean()</a></code> and <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/sd.html">sd()</a></code> summary functions individually, and not to the <code>summarize()</code> function.</p>
<p>However, one needs to be cautious whenever ignoring missing values as we’ve just done. There are possible ramifications of blindly sweeping rows with missing values “under the rug.” This is in fact why the <code>na.rm</code> argument to any summary statistic function in R is set to <code>FALSE</code> by default. In other words, R does not ignore rows with missing values by default. R is alerting you to the presence of missing data and you should be mindful of this missingness and any potential causes of this missingness throughout your analysis.</p>

<p>What are other summary functions we can use inside the <code>summarize()</code> verb to compute summary statistics? You can use any function in R that takes many values and returns just one. Here are just a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>mean(): the average</li>
<li>min() and max(): the minimum and maximum values, respectively</li>
<li>sd(): the standard deviation, which is a measure of spread</li>
<li>sum(): the total amount when adding multiple numbers</li>
<li>n(): a count of the number of rows<br>
</li>
<li>n_distinct(): the number of distinct values</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/mean.html">mean()</a></code></strong></p>
<p>The <em>mean</em> is the most commonly reported measure of center. It is commonly called the <em>average</em> though this term can be a little ambiguous. The mean is the sum of all of the data elements divided by how many elements there are. If we have <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> data points, the mean is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Mean = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n}\]</span></p>
<p><strong><code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/median.html">median()</a></code></strong></p>
<p>The median is calculated by first sorting a variable’s data from smallest to largest. After sorting the data, the middle element in the list is the <em>median</em>. If the middle falls between two values, then the median is the mean of those two middle values.</p>
<p><strong><code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/sd.html">sd()</a></code></strong></p>
<p>We will next discuss the <em>standard deviation</em> (<span class="math inline">\(sd\)</span>) of a variable. The formula can be a little intimidating at first but it is important to remember that it is essentially a measure of how far we expect a given data value will be from its mean:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[sd = \sqrt{\frac{(x_1 - Mean)^2 + (x_2 - Mean)^2 + \cdots + (x_n - Mean)^2}{n - 1}}\]</span></p>
<p>Let’s return to the <code>gain</code> variable from the previous chapter and look at some summary statistics by considering multiple summary functions at once in the same <code>summarize()</code> code:</p>

<p>We see for example that the average gain is +5 minutes, while the largest is +109 minutes! However, this code would take some time to type out in practice.</p>
<p>We can also run summary statistics <code>across()</code> multiple columns at the same time. To get a better understanding of the <code>across()</code> helper function, run <code>?across</code> in your console and see what arguments it takes. Suppose we wanted to take the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/mean.html">mean()</a></code> of both the <code>temp</code> and the <code>dewp</code> variables.</p>

<p>Say instead of a single mean temperature for the whole year, you would like 12 mean temperatures, one for each of the 12 months separately. In other words, we would like to compute the mean temperature split by month. We can do this by “grouping” temperature observations by the values of another variable, in this case by the 12 values of the variable <code>month</code>. Run the following code:</p>

<!-- DK: This whole section stinks. Please fix! -->
<p>Notice the warning. R is trying to save us from ourselves. The warning means that the tibble which issues forth from the end of the pipe has been ungrouped, meaning that it no longer has any group attribute. This is probably what we want to have happen, which is why it is the default behavior. But there are many cases in which we want to keep the group attribute, i.e., we want the resulting tibble to still be grouped by month. The warning is urging us to be sure what we want. The proper way to handle the situation, here and everywhere else that we use <code>group_by()</code> and <code>summarize()</code>, is to specify the <code>.groups</code> argument.</p>

<p>This code does the same thing as the first version, but does not issue a warning, since we have made an affirmative decision to drop any grouping variables. See <code>?summarize</code> for a discussion of other possible values for <code>.groups</code>.</p>
<p>This code is identical to the previous code that created <code>summary_temp</code>, but with an extra <code>group_by(month)</code> added before the <code>summarize()</code>. Grouping the <code>weather</code> dataset by <code>month</code> and then applying the <code>summarize()</code> functions yields a data frame that displays the mean and standard deviation temperature split by the 12 months of the year.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the <code>group_by()</code> function doesn’t change data frames by itself. Rather it changes the <em>meta-data</em>, or data about the data, specifically the grouping structure. It is only after we apply the <code>summarize()</code> function that the data frame changes.</p>
<p>Run this code (do not forget to load its package <code>nycflights13</code> in your console if you have not already):</p>

<p>Observe that now there is additional meta-data: <code># Groups: origin [3]</code> indicating that the grouping structure meta-data has been set based on the 3 possible levels of the categorical variable <code>origin</code>: <code>"EWR"</code>, <code>"JFK"</code>, and <code>"LGA"</code>.

<p>Only by combining a <code>group_by()</code> with another data wrangling operation, in this case <code>summarize()</code>, will the data actually be transformed.</p>
<p>Let’s revisit the <code>n()</code> counting summary function we briefly introduced previously. Recall that the <code>n()</code> function counts rows. This is opposed to the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/sum.html">sum()</a></code> summary function that returns the sum of a numerical variable. For example, suppose we’d like to count how many flights departed each of the three airports in New York City:</p>

<p>We see that Newark (<code>"EWR"</code>) had the most flights departing in 2013 followed by <code>"JFK"</code> and lastly by LaGuardia (<code>"LGA"</code>).

<p>If you would like to remove this grouping structure meta-data, we can pipe the resulting data frame into the <code>ungroup()</code> function:</p>

<p>You are not limited to grouping by one variable. Say you want to know the number of flights leaving each of the three New York City airports <em>for each month</em>. We can also group by a second variable <code>month</code> using <code>group_by(origin, month)</code>:</p>

<p>Observe that there are 36 rows to <code>by_origin_monthly</code> because there are 12 months for 3 airports (<code>EWR</code>, <code>JFK</code>, and <code>LGA</code>).</p>
<p>Why do we <code>group_by(origin, month)</code> and not <code>group_by(origin)</code> and then <code>group_by(month)</code>? Let’s investigate:</p>

<p>What happened here is that the second <code>group_by(month)</code> overwrote the grouping structure meta-data of the earlier <code>group_by(origin)</code>, so that in the end we are only grouping by <code>month</code>. The lesson here is if you want to <code>group_by()</code> two or more variables, you should include all the variables at the same time in the same <code>group_by()</code> adding a comma between the variable names.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Summary<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#summary"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>In the first section we looked at basic concepts and terms we are dealing with when programming with R. In section two, we learned about the three basic components that make up each plot: Data, mapping, and one or multiple geoms. The <strong>ggplot2</strong> package offers a wide range of geoms that we can use to create different types of plots. In the third section we looked at some additional elements that we can use to modify our plots. These include features such as axis scaling, labeling and themes. Finally, in the fourth section, we took a look at the “super package” <strong>tidyverse</strong>, which also includes <strong>ggplot2</strong>. Besides tools for visualization, it offers features for importing and manipulating data, which is the main topic of the next chapter.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be mentioned that we have only seen a small part of what R offers. Since R is an open source software, there are many independent developers who are constantly releasing new R packages with new features and functions. For example, we can use the <strong>gganimate</strong> package to bring our gapminder plot to life:</p>
<!-- DK: This is a nice way to end the chapter. But . . . 1) We should provide the code for all these plots, given that we are going to show them at all. 2) We should make these plots more consistent with the series which we worked through above, and with each other. For example, we should use the same axis labels. 3) We should clean up the code. For example, there is no reason that the plotly code could not start with the gapminder data. Also, isn't there a way to go straight from a ggplot2 object into a plotly object? Seems unlikely that we should be exposing the students to a radically different syntax. 4) If we are going to show rayshader, maybe make it more impressive? -->
